## Exam Domains

The GitHub Copilot exam is organized around six major functional areas. The weight percentages below reflect the most commonly published distribution for the exam.

### Domain 1: Introduction to GitHub Copilot (20%)

Covers what GitHub Copilot is, how it works, and what products are available.

**Key Topics:**
- What GitHub Copilot is and the AI models that power it (OpenAI Codex, GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini)
- Copilot product family: Copilot Individual, Copilot Business, Copilot Enterprise, Copilot Free
- Feature availability by plan (chat, PR summaries, knowledge bases, custom models)
- How Copilot differs from traditional code completion (LSP) and snippet tools
- High-level architecture: client extension, proxy, model providers, telemetry
- Supported languages (best for popular languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C#)

**What to Study:**
- Differences in features between Individual, Business, and Enterprise
- Which features are GA vs in public preview
- How context is collected from open files, tabs, and the repo

### Domain 2: Responsible Use of GitHub Copilot (15%)

Covers responsible AI, limitations, bias, accuracy, and mitigation strategies.

**Key Topics:**
- Common AI limitations: hallucinations, outdated suggestions, bias, security vulnerabilities
- Verification workflows (review, test, scan before commit)
- Duplicate detection filter and public code matching
- Content exclusions (path-based exclusion of files from context and suggestions)
- IP indemnification for Business/Enterprise with duplicate detection enabled
- Accessibility features and settings

**What to Study:**
- How and where to configure content exclusions (repo, org, enterprise levels)
- What the duplicate detection filter blocks and when
- The shared responsibility model for AI-generated code

### Domain 3: GitHub Copilot Plans and Features (15%)

Covers the feature matrix, billing, and seat management.

**Key Topics:**
- Copilot Free, Individual, Business, Enterprise feature differences
- Chat in IDE, chat in GitHub.com, PR summaries, code review, knowledge bases
- Copilot in the CLI (`gh copilot suggest`, `gh copilot explain`)
- Copilot Extensions (Marketplace, custom extensions via GitHub Apps)
- Copilot Workspace (task-centric development)
- Seat assignment, unassignment, and billing cycles

**What to Study:**
- Which chat features require Business or Enterprise
- How seats are assigned by admins and how users activate them
- What knowledge bases do and which SKU includes them (Enterprise)

### Domain 4: Using GitHub Copilot (25%)

Largest domain. Covers day-to-day usage across IDE, chat, CLI, and PR workflows.

**Key Topics:**
- Inline code completions and ghost text acceptance (Tab, Alt+] / Alt+[)
- Copilot Chat: inline, panel, quick chat, slash commands (`/explain`, `/fix`, `/tests`, `/doc`)
- Agents and participants: `@workspace`, `@terminal`, `@vscode`, `@github`
- Context providers: `#file`, `#selection`, `#codebase`, `#terminalLastCommand`
- Copilot in VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, Xcode, Eclipse
- Copilot in GitHub Mobile and GitHub.com
- Copilot pull request summaries and code review
- Copilot in the CLI

**What to Study:**
- All common chat slash commands and what they do
- Keyboard shortcuts for accepting, rejecting, and cycling suggestions
- How to attach context explicitly and when context is implicit

### Domain 5: Prompt Engineering for GitHub Copilot (10%)

Covers writing effective prompts, comments, and chat messages.

**Key Topics:**
- The 4 S's: Single, Specific, Short, Surround
- Providing examples, expected inputs and outputs
- Breaking large tasks into smaller steps
- Using neighbor tabs and open files as implicit context
- Zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot prompting with Copilot Chat
- Iterative refinement and conversational follow-ups

**What to Study:**
- How naming, comments, and docstrings influence suggestions
- How to seed a prompt with types, schemas, and imports
- When to use chat vs inline completions

### Domain 6: Developer Use Cases for AI (15%)

Covers practical and enterprise scenarios where Copilot adds value.

**Key Topics:**
- Writing new code, refactoring, writing tests, writing documentation
- Learning new languages and frameworks
- Debugging and explaining unfamiliar code
- Generating boilerplate (API clients, DTOs, migrations)
- Legacy code modernization
- DevOps scenarios (workflow YAML, Dockerfiles, Terraform, shell scripts)
- Limitations in regulated industries and what controls exist

**What to Study:**
- How Copilot helps with test generation and code review
- Where Copilot is weakest (proprietary DSLs, very recent frameworks)
- Enterprise scenarios requiring content exclusions or air-gapped workflows

## Key Concepts to Master

### Product Knowledge

3. Policy controls: suggestions matching public code, chat, network, MCP servers
4. Audit log events and seat assignment reporting

## Study Approach

### Recommended Path
1. **Week 1:** Fundamentals and plans (Domains 1, 3)
2. **Week 2:** Using Copilot in the IDE and chat (Domain 4)
3. **Week 3:** Prompt engineering and developer use cases (Domains 5, 6)
4. **Week 4:** Responsible use, administration, and review (Domains 2, plus admin cross-cutting)

### Hands-On Practice
- Install the Copilot extension in at least two IDEs (VS Code plus one more)
- Enable a Copilot Free or Individual trial and use it daily
- Try chat, inline, CLI, and GitHub.com chat surfaces
- Configure content exclusions on a test repository
- Create a workflow YAML and a test file with Copilot assistance
