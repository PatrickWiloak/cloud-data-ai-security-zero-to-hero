## Exam Tactics

### Question Strategy
1. **Read the full question** - Identify what is being asked (best practice, correct command, right feature)
2. **Eliminate wrong answers** - Remove obviously incorrect options first
3. **Look for keywords** - "best," "most appropriate," "correct" signal specific answers
4. **Consider the GitHub way** - GitHub exams favor platform-native solutions
5. **Think about the workflow** - Many questions test proper workflow order

### Time Management
- **75 questions in 120 minutes** = ~1.6 minutes per question
- **First pass (80 minutes):** Answer questions you are confident about, flag uncertain ones
- **Second pass (30 minutes):** Return to flagged questions with fresh perspective
- **Final review (10 minutes):** Check for unanswered questions, verify flagged answers
- Do not spend more than 3 minutes on any single question

### Question Types to Expect
- **Factual recall** - What does command X do? What is feature Y?
- **Scenario-based** - Given this situation, what is the best approach?
- **Comparison** - What is the difference between X and Y?
- **Best practice** - What is the recommended way to do X?
- **Feature identification** - Which GitHub feature solves this problem?

### Key Differentiators to Study
These pairs/groups are commonly tested because they are easy to confuse:

| Concept A | Concept B | Key Difference |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| `git fetch` | `git pull` | fetch downloads only; pull downloads and merges |
| Fork | Clone | Fork is server-side copy; clone is local copy |
| Merge commit | Squash merge | Merge preserves history; squash creates one commit |
| Branch | Tag | Branch is movable; tag is fixed at a commit |
| Issues | Discussions | Issues track work; discussions are conversations |
| PAT (classic) | Fine-grained PAT | Classic has broad scopes; fine-grained has per-repo permissions |
| Public repo | Internal repo | Public is visible to everyone; internal is org-only |
| `git reset` | `git revert` | Reset removes commits; revert creates new undoing commit |
| GitHub-hosted runner | Self-hosted runner | GitHub-hosted is managed; self-hosted is your infrastructure |
| Classic Projects | New Projects | Classic is per-repo kanban; new is cross-repo with custom fields |

## Common Pitfalls

### Git Concepts
- **Confusing `git fetch` and `git pull`** - fetch does NOT merge; pull does both
- **Not understanding merge vs rebase** - rebase rewrites history, merge preserves it
- **Forgetting `git stash`** - useful for temporarily saving work without committing
- **Mixing up `git reset` modes** - soft, mixed, hard have different effects
- **Ignoring `.gitignore`** - files already tracked are not affected by adding to .gitignore

### GitHub Platform
- **Thinking fork is the same as clone** - fork creates a copy on GitHub; clone creates local copy
- **Not knowing branch protection details** - understand all available protection options
- **Confusing organization roles** - Owner, Member, and Outside Collaborator have different permissions
- **Overlooking GitHub Plans differences** - know what each plan includes
- **Forgetting about draft PRs** - they signal work in progress and prevent accidental merging

### Exam Strategy
- **Rushing through questions** - take time to read the full question and all options
- **Over-studying low-weight domains** - focus effort proportional to domain weight
- **Only reading without practicing** - hands-on experience is critical for this exam
- **Ignoring the official study guide** - it tells you exactly what to study
- **Not reviewing incorrect practice answers** - understanding why you were wrong is more valuable than getting answers right

### Security Topics
- **Thinking 2FA is optional** - GitHub requires 2FA for all accounts
- **Confusing PAT types** - classic vs fine-grained have different scoping models
- **Not understanding SSH key workflow** - know how to generate and add SSH keys
- **Overlooking Dependabot** - it is a key security feature for dependency management
- **Mixing up secret scanning and code scanning** - secrets detect credentials; code scanning finds code vulnerabilities
