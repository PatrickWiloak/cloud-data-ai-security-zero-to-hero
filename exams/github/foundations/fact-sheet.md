- Fork creates a server-side copy; clone creates a local copy
- Squash merge creates one commit; merge commit preserves all
- Issues track work; Discussions are for conversations
- Classic Projects are per-repo; new Projects are cross-repo
- Personal Access Tokens (classic) vs fine-grained tokens
- GitHub-hosted runners vs self-hosted runners
