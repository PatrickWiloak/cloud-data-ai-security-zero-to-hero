## Study Tips

### Time Allocation by Domain Weight

| Domain | Weight | Suggested Hours |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Code Scanning and CodeQL | 25% | 15-20 hours |
| Secret Scanning and Push Protection | 20% | 10-14 hours |
| Dependency Review and Dependabot | 20% | 10-14 hours |
| GHAS Overview and Licensing | 15% | 7-10 hours |
| Security Advisories | 10% | 5-7 hours |
| Administration | 10% | 5-7 hours |

### Recommended Daily Schedule
- **30 min** reading GHAS docs or notes
- **45 min** hands-on in a sandbox org
- **15 min** flashcards on query suites, YAML, and alerts
- **Total: ~1.5 hours/day**

### Hands-On Labs
1. Enable default code scanning on a Node.js app; review initial alerts
2. Upload a Semgrep SARIF file and confirm alerts
3. Create a custom secret scanning pattern for an internal token format
4. Write a `dependabot.yml` covering three ecosystems with grouped updates
5. Create, coordinate, and publish a repository security advisory end-to-end
6. Build a security configuration and apply it to five repos at once
