# Workload-Specific Database Design - AWS Database Specialty

## Overview

Workload-specific database design covers 26% of the DBS-C01 exam - the largest domain. This domain focuses on choosing the right database service for specific use cases and understanding the design considerations for each.

## Amazon RDS

**[📖 RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)** - Relational Database Service

### Supported Engines

| Engine | Max Storage | Max Read Replicas | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| MySQL | 64 TB | 15 | Web apps, WordPress, general OLTP |
| PostgreSQL | 64 TB | 15 | Complex queries, PostGIS, extensions |

### Key Features

- **Multi-AZ**: Synchronous standby replica, automatic failover (< 60 sec)
- **Read Replicas**: Asynchronous replication, can be cross-region
- **Storage Types**: gp3 (general), io1/io2 (provisioned IOPS), magnetic (legacy)
- **Automated Backups**: Point-in-time recovery, 0-35 day retention
- **Manual Snapshots**: User-initiated, unlimited retention
- **RDS Proxy**: Connection pooling, reduces failover time by 66%

**[📖 Multi-AZ Deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html)** - High availability

### When to Use RDS

- Traditional relational workloads (OLTP)
- Existing applications using MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL Server
- Need for complex queries, joins, and ACID transactions
- Do not need more than 64 TB storage or microsecond latency

## Amazon Aurora

**[📖 Aurora User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html)** - Cloud-native relational database

### Architecture

- Storage layer: 6 copies across 3 AZs, auto-scales 10 GB to 128 TB
- Quorum writes (4/6) and reads (3/6) for high durability
- Continuous backup to S3 with 1-second granularity
- Storage is independent of compute - shared across replicas
- Redo log-based replication (not binlog) - <100ms replica lag

### Aurora Variants

**Aurora Provisioned:**
- Writer instance + up to 15 read replicas
- Automatic failover to replica in < 30 seconds
- Reader endpoint for load-balanced reads

**Aurora Serverless v2:**
- Scales between 0.5 and 128 ACUs (Aurora Capacity Units)
- Fine-grained scaling in 0.5 ACU increments
- Sub-second scaling response
- Good for variable or unpredictable workloads

**Aurora Global Database:**
- Cross-region replication with < 1 second lag
- Up to 5 secondary regions
- RPO < 1 second, RTO < 1 minute for planned failover
- Write forwarding from secondary to primary region
- Managed planned failover and unplanned (detach) failover

**[📖 Aurora Global Database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html)** - Cross-region replication
**[📖 Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html)** - Auto-scaling compute

### When to Use Aurora

- Need cross-region disaster recovery with low RPO
- Variable workloads (Serverless v2)

## Amazon DynamoDB

**[📖 DynamoDB Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)** - NoSQL key-value and document

### Core Concepts

- **Tables, Items, Attributes**: Schema-less except for primary key
- **Primary Key**: Partition key (hash) or partition key + sort key (hash + range)
- **Secondary Indexes**: GSI (any attribute as key, separate throughput) and LSI (same partition key, different sort key, created at table creation)
- **Capacity Modes**: On-demand (pay per request) or Provisioned (specify RCU/WCU)

### Key Features

- Single-digit millisecond latency at any scale
- Automatic multi-AZ replication (3 AZs)
- **DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)**: In-memory cache, microsecond reads
- **Global Tables**: Multi-region, multi-active replication
- **Streams**: Ordered change data capture (24-hour retention)
- **TTL**: Automatic item expiration
- **PartiQL**: SQL-compatible query language for DynamoDB

**[📖 DynamoDB Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/best-practices.html)** - Design patterns
**[📖 Global Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html)** - Multi-region

### Data Modeling

- Design for access patterns first (not entities)
- Single table design: Store multiple entity types in one table
- Composite sort keys: Combine attributes for flexible querying
- Sparse indexes: GSI on attribute that not all items have
- Overloaded GSI: Reuse GSI for multiple query patterns
- Avoid hot partitions: Distribute writes evenly across partition keys

### When to Use DynamoDB

- Key-value or simple document access patterns
- Need single-digit millisecond latency
- Need automatic scaling with unpredictable traffic

## Common Exam Patterns

1. **"Microsecond reads on DynamoDB"** - DAX (not ElastiCache)
2. **"Multi-region active-active relational"** - Not natively supported; use Aurora Global Database (active-passive with write forwarding)
3. **"Multi-region active-active NoSQL"** - DynamoDB Global Tables
4. **"Audit trail with cryptographic verification"** - QLDB
5. **"Graph relationships"** - Neptune
6. **"MongoDB migration"** - DocumentDB
7. **"Cassandra migration"** - Keyspaces
8. **"Variable relational workload"** - Aurora Serverless v2
9. **"Cross-region disaster recovery < 1 sec RPO"** - Aurora Global Database
10. **"Connection pooling for Lambda"** - RDS Proxy
