# AWS Quantum Practitioner - Fact Sheet (Anticipated)

## Important Notice

This certification is anticipated based on AWS direction with Amazon Braket. As of this writing, AWS has not formally announced an exam with the QPC-C01 code, format, or pricing. The fields below represent realistic estimates derived from adjacent AWS specialty exams (AIF, MLA, MLS, DAS, ANS) and public Braket capabilities. Verify all details against AWS Training and Certification when the exam is officially released.

## Key Concepts by Domain

### Domain 1: Fundamentals
- Qubit, superposition, entanglement, measurement, decoherence
- Bloch sphere visualization
- State vector representation; Dirac notation (|0>, |1>, |+>, |->)
- Pauli matrices (X, Y, Z), Hadamard (H), phase (S, T)
- Unitary evolution and reversibility
- No-cloning theorem
- Bell states and their preparation

### Domain 2: Amazon Braket
- Braket service architecture: notebooks, hybrid jobs, tasks, devices
- SDK (Python amazon-braket-sdk)
- Supported hardware: IonQ (Aria, Forte), Rigetti (Ankaa), IQM (Garnet), QuEra (Aquila, neutral atom)
- Simulators: SV1 (state vector), DM1 (density matrix), local simulators (TN1 is retired)
- IAM permissions: braket:CreateQuantumTask, GetQuantumTask, etc.
- S3 result storage
- CloudWatch metrics, CloudTrail audit
- Braket Pulse for low-level pulse control
- Braket Direct for reserved capacity

### Domain 3: Circuits and Gates
- Single-qubit gates: I, X, Y, Z, H, S, T, Rx, Ry, Rz
- Multi-qubit gates: CNOT, CZ, SWAP, CCNOT (Toffoli), CSWAP (Fredkin)
- Universal gate sets
- Circuit depth and width
- Native gate sets per QPU (varies by hardware)
- Circuit transpilation and optimization
- Compilation strategies

### Domain 4: Hybrid Workflows
- Braket Hybrid Jobs: container-based hybrid execution
- Variational algorithms requiring classical optimizer + quantum circuit
- Priority queueing for hybrid jobs
- BYO container or managed PennyLane container
- Integration with Amazon SageMaker for ML
- Result aggregation and post-processing

### Domain 5: Algorithms
- Grover's algorithm (search; quadratic speedup)
- Shor's algorithm (factoring; conceptual at exam scale)
- Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
- Quantum Machine Learning basics
- Annealing (relevant for some hardware)
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

### Domain 6: Cost and Operations
- Per-task pricing + per-shot pricing model
- Device-specific pricing (varies significantly)
- Reservation model (Braket Direct)
- Hybrid Job pricing (compute + quantum)
- Simulator pricing per minute
- Cost monitoring with AWS Cost Explorer and tagging
- Error mitigation strategies and cost trade-off
- Choosing simulator vs QPU for development phase

## Hardware on Amazon Braket (verify current list)

| Provider | Modality | Devices (representative) |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| IonQ | Trapped ion | Aria, Forte |
| Rigetti | Superconducting | Ankaa |
| IQM | Superconducting | Garnet |
| QuEra | Neutral atom (analog Hamiltonian) | Aquila |

Hardware comes and goes from Braket; always check `device.is_available` and the AWS console for current devices and queue depths.

## Simulators on Amazon Braket

| Simulator | Type | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| SV1 | State vector | General purpose, up to ~34 qubits |
| DM1 | Density matrix | Simulating noise, smaller qubit count |
| LocalSimulator | In-process | Free for development; limited size |
