# AWS Certified Generative AI Developer - Professional (AIP-C01)

The AWS Certified Generative AI Developer - Professional (AIP-C01) certification validates the ability to integrate foundation models (FMs) into production applications and business workflows on AWS. It is a Professional-tier credential targeted at developers who already build production-grade applications and have hands-on experience implementing GenAI solutions.

## What the exam validates

The exam validates a candidate's ability to:

- Design and implement solutions using vector stores, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), knowledge bases, and other GenAI architectures.
- Integrate FMs into applications and business workflows.
- Apply prompt engineering and management techniques.
- Implement agentic AI solutions.
- Optimize GenAI applications for cost, performance, and business value.
- Implement security, governance, and Responsible AI practices.
- Troubleshoot, monitor, and optimize GenAI applications.
- Evaluate FMs for quality and responsibility.

## Domain weightings

| Domain | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| 1. Foundation Model Integration, Data Management, and Compliance | 31% |
| 2. Implementation and Integration | 26% |

## 1-week study schedule (today is 2026-05-08, target exam ~2026-05-17)

This schedule is weighted by domain percentage. Day 1 starts heaviest because Domain 1 is the largest (31%) and covers the foundational concepts (RAG, vector stores, prompt engineering, FM customization) that the rest of the exam builds on.

| Day | Date | Focus | Hours (target) |
|-----|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | 2026-05-08 (Fri) | Read [fact-sheet](fact-sheet.md), [Domain 1](notes/01-foundation-models-data-compliance.md) tasks 1.1-1.3 (architecture, FM selection, data pipelines) | 3-4 |
| 2 | 2026-05-09 (Sat) | [Domain 1](notes/01-foundation-models-data-compliance.md) tasks 1.4-1.6 (vector stores, retrieval, prompt engineering) + [RAG deep-dive](notes/rag-architecture-deep-dive.md) | 4-5 |
| 3 | 2026-05-10 (Sun) | [Domain 2](notes/02-implementation-integration.md) (all tasks) + [Agentic AI deep-dive](notes/agentic-ai-systems.md) | 4-5 |
| 4 | 2026-05-11 (Mon) | [Bedrock platform deep-dive](notes/bedrock-platform-deep-dive.md) end-to-end + [Prompt engineering deep-dive](notes/prompt-engineering-and-management.md) | 3-4 |

Adjust the dates to your actual exam date. Total target study load: ~25-30 focused hours across 8 days.

## How to read these notes

- Each domain note begins with the **verbatim list of exam Tasks and Skills** from the official guide. This is your checklist - if you understand every Skill, you can pass that domain.
- The cross-cutting deep-dives go several layers deeper than the domain notes on the highest-leverage topics. Read them after the corresponding domain note, not before.
- Every note ends with a **Quick-recall summary** - dense bullet list designed for last-week skimming. Treat these as your cram sheet.
- Service names use AWS short names where standard (Amazon SNS, not Amazon Simple Notification Service) - the exam itself does the same, per the official "Mentions of AWS services on the exam" page.

## Prerequisites you should already have

Per the official target candidate description:

- 2+ years of experience building production-grade applications on AWS or with open-source technologies
- General AI/ML or data engineering experience
- 1+ year of hands-on experience implementing GenAI solutions
- Working familiarity with AWS compute, storage, networking, IAM, IaC, observability, and cost optimization

If any of these is shaky, the AIP-C01 will be brutal in 1 week. Prioritize hands-on Bedrock + Knowledge Bases + Agents work over reading.

## Out of scope (don't waste study time)

The exam explicitly excludes these job tasks:

- **Model development and training** (you won't be tested on training a transformer from scratch)
- **Advanced ML techniques** (no math-heavy ML theory)
- **Data engineering and feature engineering** (no detailed Glue/EMR/Spark transformations)

A condensed list of out-of-scope AWS services (don't waste time on these): DeepRacer, DeepComposer, Forecast, Fraud Detector, Lookout family, Monitron, HealthLake, Panorama, Redshift, Timestream, Lightsail, Beanstalk, Snow Family, IoT family, Alexa for Business, GameLift, Braket. Full list in the [fact sheet](fact-sheet.md).
