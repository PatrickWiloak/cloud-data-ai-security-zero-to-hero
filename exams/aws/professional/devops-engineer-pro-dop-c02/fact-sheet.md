## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
✅ **DO:**
- Store secrets in Secrets Manager or Parameter Store (SecureString)
- Enable automatic rotation for database credentials
- Use IAM roles for applications to retrieve secrets
- Encrypt secrets with KMS customer-managed keys
- Use resource-based policies to restrict access
- Enable CloudTrail logging for secret access

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hardcode secrets in code or configuration files
- Store secrets in environment variables (plain text)
- Commit secrets to version control
- Share secrets via email or chat
- Use the same secret across environments

### IAM Least Privilege
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Use IAM roles (not users) for applications
- Implement permission boundaries
- Regular access reviews with IAM Access Analyzer
- Use service-specific roles (not broad permissions)

### Encryption
- Enable encryption at rest for all data stores (S3, RDS, EBS, DynamoDB)
- Use TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data
- Enable CloudTrail log file encryption
- Rotate encryption keys regularly

## Auto Scaling Best Practices

### Target Tracking (Recommended)
- Simplest to configure
- Specify target metric value (e.g., CPU 50%)
- Auto Scaling automatically adjusts
- Supports custom metrics

### Step Scaling
- More granular control
- Different scaling amounts based on alarm thresholds
- Example: Add 1 instance if CPU > 60%, add 3 if CPU > 80%

### Predictive Scaling
- ML-powered forecasting based on historical data
- Schedules capacity changes before predicted load
- Combine with target tracking for optimal results

### Scaling Metrics
- **CPU Utilization** - Most common, but may lag
- **Request Count per Target** - Better for request-based scaling
- **Network In/Out** - For network-intensive applications
- **Custom Metrics** - Application-specific (queue depth, active connections)

## Exam Strategy

### Time Management
- 180 minutes ÷ 75 questions = 2.4 minutes per question
- Scenarios can be long (2-3 paragraphs)
- Don't get stuck on difficult questions
- Flag and move on, return later

### Question Keywords
- **"Most cost-effective"** → Managed services, spot instances, S3 lifecycle
- **"Least operational overhead"** → Managed services, automation, serverless
- **"Secure"** → Secrets Manager, KMS, least privilege IAM, encryption
- **"Automated"** → EventBridge, Lambda, SSM Automation, Config
- **"Zero downtime"** → Blue/green, rolling, canary deployments

### Common Traps
- ❌ Overcomplicating solutions (choose simplest that meets requirements)
