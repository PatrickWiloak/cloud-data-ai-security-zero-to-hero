## Exam Tips

### Question Strategy
1. **Read carefully** - identify key operational requirements
2. **Look for keywords:**
   - "Most operationally efficient" - managed services, automation
   - "Least cost" - right-sizing, Reserved Instances, Spot
   - "Automate" - CloudFormation, CDK, Systems Manager
   - "Monitor" - CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudTrail
   - "Secure" - IAM, encryption, VPC isolation
3. **Eliminate wrong answers** - usually 2 choices are clearly incorrect
4. **Choose AWS-native solutions** - prefer managed services when appropriate

### Time Management
- 130 minutes for 65 questions = 2 minutes per question
- Flag uncertain questions and return later
- Don't spend more than 3 minutes on any question initially
- Leave 15-20 minutes for review

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing CloudWatch metrics vs CloudWatch Logs
- Not understanding CloudFormation update behaviors (replacement vs in-place)
- Mixing up security groups (stateful) and NACLs (stateless)
- Overlooking Systems Manager as a solution for operational tasks
- Forgetting cross-account and cross-region considerations
