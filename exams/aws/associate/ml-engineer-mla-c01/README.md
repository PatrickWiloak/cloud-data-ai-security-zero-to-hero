## Exam Tips

### Question Strategy
1. **Read carefully** - identify whether the question asks about data prep, training, deployment, or monitoring
2. **Look for keywords:**
   - "Most cost-effective" - Spot training, serverless inference, batch transform
   - "Least operational effort" - managed services, built-in algorithms, Autopilot
   - "Real-time" - SageMaker endpoints with auto-scaling
   - "Large-scale batch" - Batch Transform
   - "Detect drift" - Model Monitor
   - "Feature reuse" - Feature Store
3. **SageMaker is usually the answer** - prefer SageMaker-native solutions
4. **Consider the ML lifecycle stage** - data prep, training, deployment, or monitoring

### Time Management
- 170 minutes for 85 questions = 2 minutes per question
- Flag uncertain questions and return later
- Don't spend more than 3 minutes on any question initially
- Leave 20 minutes for review

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing SageMaker endpoint types (real-time vs serverless vs async)
- Not understanding Feature Store online vs offline stores
- Overlooking Model Monitor capabilities for drift detection
- Forgetting about SageMaker Pipelines for workflow orchestration
- Mixing up training instance types for different workloads
