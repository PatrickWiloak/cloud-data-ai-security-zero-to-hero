## Domain 1: Understanding FinOps (20%)

This domain covers the foundational concepts of the FinOps framework, including principles, lifecycle phases, and organizational structure.

### FinOps Principles

The six principles of FinOps form the foundation of cloud financial management:

1. **Teams need to collaborate** - Finance, engineering, and business work together
2. **Everyone takes ownership for their cloud usage** - Decentralized decision-making with central governance
3. **A centralized team drives FinOps** - Dedicated team establishes best practices and processes
4. **Reports should be accessible and timely** - Real-time data available to all stakeholders
5. **Decisions are driven by the business value of cloud** - Cost optimization balanced with speed and quality
6. **Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud** - Leverage elasticity and pay-per-use pricing

**[📖 FinOps Principles](https://www.finops.org/framework/principles/)** - Detailed explanation of each principle
**[📖 FinOps Lifecycle](https://www.finops.org/framework/phases/)** - Inform, Optimize, Operate phases

### FinOps Lifecycle Phases

- Provide visibility into cloud spending
- Allocate costs to teams and projects
- Create shared understanding of cost data
- Enable data-driven decision making

**Optimize Phase:**
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Implement rate and usage optimizations
- Reduce waste and improve efficiency
- Balance cost with performance

**Operate Phase:**
- Establish governance and policies
- Automate cost management processes
- Continuously improve FinOps maturity
- Align cloud spending with business goals

## Domain 2: Inform Phase (30%)

### Cost Allocation and Tagging

**Tagging Strategies:**
- Mandatory tags: cost center, environment, owner, project
- Optional tags: team, application, service, compliance
- Tag governance: enforcement policies and automation
- Tag hygiene: regular audits and cleanup

**Cost Allocation Methods:**
- **Direct allocation**: Costs assigned directly to consuming teams
- **Shared costs**: Distributed across teams based on usage or agreed formula
- **Amortized costs**: Upfront commitments spread over time
- **Unallocated costs**: Costs that cannot be attributed to specific teams

### Showback vs Chargeback

**Showback:**
- Reports costs to teams without billing them
- Lower organizational friction
- Useful for building cost awareness
- Good starting point for FinOps adoption

**Chargeback:**
- Bills costs directly to responsible teams
- Drives stronger accountability
- Requires mature cost allocation
- May create organizational resistance

**[📖 Forecasting](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/forecasting/)** - Budgeting and forecasting practices

### Unit Economics

**Key Metrics:**
- Cost per customer
- Cost per transaction
- Cost per environment
- Cost per deployment
- Infrastructure cost as percentage of revenue
