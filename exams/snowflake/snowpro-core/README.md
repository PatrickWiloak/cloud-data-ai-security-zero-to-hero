- Recursive CTEs

### Domain 6: Data Protection and Data Sharing (10%)
- Time Travel
- Fail-safe
- Data sharing
- Snowflake Marketplace
- Replication and failover
- Cloning

**Key Concepts:**
- Time Travel retention periods (0-90 days, edition-dependent)
- Fail-safe (7 days, non-configurable, Snowflake managed)
- Zero-copy cloning and metadata operations
- Direct data sharing (no data movement)
- Reader accounts for non-Snowflake customers
- Secure Data Sharing with listings
- Snowflake Marketplace providers and consumers
- Database and share replication across regions/clouds
- Account replication and failover groups
- Data exchange for private sharing

## Key Study Focus Areas

### Architecture Deep Dive
Understanding Snowflake's unique architecture is the most heavily weighted domain. Focus on:
- How the three layers work independently and together
- Virtual warehouse behavior during scaling
- How micro-partitions store and organize data
- The role of the cloud services layer in query optimization
- How caching works at each layer

### Security Model
The second-largest domain requires thorough knowledge of:
- RBAC model and role hierarchy
- When to use each system-defined role
- Network security features
- Encryption methods and key management
- Authentication options

### SQL and Transformations
This domain tests practical Snowflake SQL knowledge:
- Semi-structured data handling (VARIANT, OBJECT, ARRAY)
- Change data capture with streams
- Task scheduling and management
- Stored procedures vs UDFs

## Study Approach

### Recommended Preparation Time
- **Beginners:** 6-8 weeks with daily study
- **Experienced Snowflake Users:** 3-4 weeks focused review
- **Database Professionals:** 4-5 weeks with hands-on practice

### Study Path
1. Start with Snowflake's free trial account for hands-on practice
2. Review official Snowflake documentation for each domain
3. Complete Snowflake University courses (free with trial)
4. Practice with sample queries and real-world scenarios
5. Take practice exams and review weak areas
6. Focus final review on architecture and security domains

### Hands-on Practice Priorities
- Create and manage virtual warehouses of different sizes
- Load data using COPY INTO and Snowpipe
- Work with semi-structured data (JSON, Parquet)
- Implement role hierarchies and access control
- Use Time Travel and cloning features
- Set up resource monitors
- Create and manage streams and tasks
- Query the Snowflake Marketplace

### Common Exam Pitfalls
- Confusing result cache with warehouse cache behavior
- Mixing up stage types and their use cases
- Not understanding role hierarchy inheritance
- Confusing Time Travel with Fail-safe capabilities
- Misunderstanding multi-cluster warehouse scaling policies
- Not knowing edition-specific feature availability
- Confusing Snowpipe with COPY INTO use cases
