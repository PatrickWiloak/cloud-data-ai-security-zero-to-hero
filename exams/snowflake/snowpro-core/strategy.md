   - Understand the three-layer architecture (storage, compute, cloud services)
   - Learn how micro-partitions work and how data is organized
   - Study virtual warehouse sizing, scaling, and credit consumption
   - Understand each Snowflake edition and its exclusive features
   - Review cloud services layer responsibilities

2. **Account and Security Basics**
   - Learn the system-defined role hierarchy (ACCOUNTADMIN down to PUBLIC)
   - Practice creating custom roles and granting privileges
   - Understand authentication methods (MFA, SSO, key pair)
   - Study network policies and encryption options

3. **Hands-on Setup**
   - Create a Snowflake free trial account (30 days, $400 credit)

   - Create databases, schemas, and tables
   - Experiment with different warehouse sizes

### Phase 2: Core Skills (Weeks 3-4)

1. **Data Loading and Unloading**
   - Practice COPY INTO from all stage types
   - Set up Snowpipe with auto-ingest
   - Load various file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
   - Test ON_ERROR and VALIDATION_MODE options
   - Practice data unloading to stages

2. **Data Transformations**
   - Work extensively with semi-structured data (VARIANT)

   - Create stored procedures in SQL and JavaScript
   - Build UDFs for common transformations
   - Set up streams and tasks for CDC pipelines

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze queries using Query Profile
   - Experiment with clustering keys on large datasets
   - Test caching behavior (result, warehouse, metadata)
   - Set up resource monitors
   - Practice warehouse scaling scenarios

### Phase 3: Exam Preparation (Weeks 5-6)

1. **Practice Exams and Gap Analysis**
   - Take at least 3 full practice exams
   - Score each exam and identify weak domains
   - Create a focused review list for topics below 80% accuracy
   - Re-read documentation for weak areas
   - Retake practice exams to measure improvement

2. **Final Review Strategy**
   - Review the fact sheet for rapid recall
   - Go through all exam scenarios
   - Focus on commonly confused concepts
   - Review edition-specific features table
   - Practice time management with timed mock exams

3. **Day Before Exam**
   - Light review only - do not cram new material
   - Review the caching comparison table
   - Review role hierarchy diagram
   - Skim edition features one more time
   - Get adequate rest

## Exam Tactics

### Question Approach
1. Read the question stem carefully - identify what is being asked
2. Look for keywords: "best," "most cost-effective," "most secure," "least operational overhead"
3. Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
4. Consider Snowflake-specific features over generic approaches
5. When two answers seem correct, pick the one more specific to Snowflake

### Time Management
- **Total time:** 115 minutes for 100 questions
- **Pace:** About 1 minute per question
- **First pass:** Answer confident questions quickly (60-70 minutes)
- **Second pass:** Return to flagged questions (30-40 minutes)
- **Final review:** Scan all answers (10-15 minutes)
- Do not spend more than 2 minutes on any single question in the first pass

### Answer Strategies
- "All of the above" or "None of the above" answers require extra scrutiny
- If a question mentions a specific edition feature, verify the edition
- Questions about "best practice" usually have one clearly superior answer
- Pay attention to "NOT" or "EXCEPT" in question stems
- When unsure, choose the answer that aligns with Snowflake's architectural principles

## Common Pitfalls

### Architecture Misconceptions
- Virtual warehouses do NOT store data - they are compute only
- Result cache does NOT require a running warehouse
- Cloud services layer is NOT just for authentication - it handles metadata, optimization, and more
- Micro-partitions are NOT user-configurable - they are automatic
- Scaling up a warehouse does NOT retroactively speed up running queries

### Security Misconceptions
- ACCOUNTADMIN should NOT be the default role for daily tasks
- Custom roles should be granted TO SYSADMIN (not the other way around)
- Network policies apply to the ENTIRE account unless scoped to specific users
- MFA is NOT enabled by default - users must enroll individually
- Row access policies and column masking are Enterprise+ features

### Data Loading Misconceptions
- Snowpipe uses its OWN compute - not your virtual warehouses
- COPY INTO is idempotent by default (skips already-loaded files for 64 days)
- PUT command only works with INTERNAL stages
- External stages require storage integration OR direct credentials
- VALIDATION_MODE does NOT actually load data

### Performance Misconceptions
- Bigger warehouse does NOT always mean faster queries
- Clustering keys are NOT recommended for tables under 1 TB
- Auto-clustering has ongoing costs - it is not a one-time operation
- Result cache is invalidated when underlying data changes
- Materialized views are NOT available in Standard edition

### Data Protection Misconceptions
- Time Travel and Fail-safe are NOT the same thing
- Fail-safe CANNOT be accessed directly by users
- Cloning is a METADATA operation - no data is copied initially
- Data sharing does NOT copy data to the consumer
- Reader accounts are paid for by the PROVIDER, not the consumer
