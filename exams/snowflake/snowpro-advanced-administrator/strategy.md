2. **Security Fundamentals**
   - Master system-defined roles and their hierarchy
   - Design custom role hierarchies for enterprise scenarios
   - Learn authentication methods (MFA, SSO, SCIM, key pair)
   - Study network policies and Private Link configuration

### Phase 2: Core Skills (2-3 weeks)
1. **Resource Management and Cost Control**
   - Configure resource monitors with appropriate triggers
   - Study warehouse optimization strategies
   - Learn credit tracking using ACCOUNT_USAGE views
   - Practice storage optimization techniques

2. **Performance Monitoring**

## Exam Tactics

### Question Strategy
1. **Role questions:** Know which system role has which responsibility
2. **Parameter questions:** Know the difference between account, session, and object levels
3. **Cost questions:** Understand all cost levers and monitoring tools
4. **Security questions:** Think defense-in-depth and least privilege
5. **Compliance questions:** Know edition-specific feature availability

### Time Management
- ~1.75 minutes per question (65 questions in 115 minutes)
- Flag security scenario questions for careful review
- Answer direct knowledge questions quickly
- Reserve time for multi-select questions

## Common Pitfalls

### Study Mistakes
- Not practicing with ACCOUNT_USAGE views
- Ignoring parameter hierarchy (account vs session vs object)
- Not understanding Time Travel/Fail-safe storage cost implications
- Skipping compliance and edition feature mapping

### Exam Mistakes
- Confusing SECURITYADMIN with USERADMIN responsibilities
- Not knowing that resource monitors only track warehouse credits
- Forgetting ACCOUNT_USAGE view latency (2-3 hours for most views)
- Thinking transient tables have Fail-safe protection
- Not knowing that ORGADMIN cannot access data in accounts
