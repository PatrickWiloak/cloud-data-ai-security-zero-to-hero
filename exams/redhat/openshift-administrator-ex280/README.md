# Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration (EX280)

## Overview

The Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration validates the skills required to operate Red Hat OpenShift clusters in production. Like RHCSA, this is a **performance-based, hands-on exam** - you'll run actual `oc` commands on a live cluster to complete tasks.

This cert is the canonical credential for OpenShift platform administrators and a step on the path to **Red Hat Certified Architect**.

## What You'll Do on the Exam

Tasks span the OpenShift admin lifecycle:

1. **Cluster operations** - install / upgrade / configure cluster components, manage cluster nodes, configure cluster authentication.
2. **Project and quota management** - create projects, apply resource quotas and limit ranges, configure default project templates.
3. **Identity and RBAC** - configure identity providers, create users / groups, assign cluster and project roles.
4. **Workload operations** - deploy applications, scale, configure deployment strategies, troubleshoot pods.
5. **Networking** - configure routes, services, network policies, ingress.
6. **Storage** - configure persistent volumes, storage classes, PVCs, storage drivers.
7. **Security and compliance** - SCCs (Security Context Constraints), pod security admission, network policies.
8. **Operators and Operator Lifecycle Manager** - install operators, manage operator subscriptions and channels.
9. **Monitoring and metrics** - configure cluster monitoring, view metrics, create alerts.
10. **Troubleshooting** - logs, events, must-gather, debug pods.

The exam is **closed book** but you have access to:

- The OpenShift web console
- `oc explain` for resource fields
- Pre-installed CLI documentation
- The cluster itself (you can read existing resources)

## Recommended Study Time

| Background | Estimated Prep Time |
|---|---|
| OpenShift admin experience (1+ year), holds RHCSA | 4 weeks |
| Kubernetes admin (CKA-equivalent), new to OpenShift | 6 weeks |
| New to containers and Kubernetes | 10-12 weeks; consider RHCSA first |

Plan on heavy hands-on lab time. This is a performance exam.

## Lab Setup

You **cannot pass without hands-on practice.** Options:

### Best: Red Hat-provided

- **OpenShift Local (formerly CodeReady Containers / CRC)** - free single-node OpenShift on your laptop. Requires 9+ GB RAM and 4+ vCPUs. [Download](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview)
- **Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift** - free 30-day shared cluster. [Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox)
- **Red Hat Learning Subscription Trial** - access to RH364 (Red Hat OpenShift Administration II) labs.

### Realistic alternative: managed OpenShift

- **ROSA** (Red Hat OpenShift on AWS) - paid, but you can keep usage minimal during prep.
- **ARO** (Azure Red Hat OpenShift) - similar.

### Last resort: vanilla Kubernetes

- **kind / minikube / k3s** can teach you concepts but miss OpenShift-specific things (Routes, SCCs, Operators, OperatorHub, oc CLI).

OpenShift Local is the recommended free path.

## Key Differences vs. CKA / Vanilla Kubernetes

OpenShift differs from vanilla Kubernetes in important ways the exam tests:

| Area | OpenShift | Vanilla K8s |
|---|---|---|
| CLI | `oc` (superset of `kubectl`) | `kubectl` |
| Namespaces | Called **Projects** (with extra metadata) | Just namespaces |
| Ingress | **Routes** (OpenShift-specific resource) | Ingress |
| Pod security | **SCC (Security Context Constraints)** | PSA (Pod Security Admission) |
| User accounts | First-class **User** and **Group** resources | External (RBAC subjects) |
| App build | **BuildConfig**, **ImageStream**, **DeploymentConfig** (legacy + Deployment) | Just Deployment |
| Operators | **OperatorHub** + OLM built in | Operators are optional |
| Default install | Includes monitoring, logging, registry, console, OAuth | Minimal |

If you come from CKA, focus on Routes, SCCs, OperatorHub, ImageStreams, and Projects.

## Exam-Day Tips

1. **Use `oc explain`** when you forget a field name. `oc explain pod.spec.containers.resources` is your friend.
2. **Use the web console** for things faster than typing. The console can generate YAML for resources.
3. **Save YAML to disk** for any complex resource. `oc edit` works but `oc apply -f file.yaml` is more recoverable.
4. **Verify after every change**. `oc get`, `oc describe`, `oc logs`.
5. **Check existing examples** on the cluster. `oc get pod -o yaml` shows you what a working pod's YAML looks like - use as a template.
6. **Don't forget labels and selectors.** Many tasks involve creating a Service or NetworkPolicy that selects on labels.
7. **Read the task fully.** Specific names, namespaces, replica counts matter.
