## High Availability and Disaster Recovery

### HA Concepts
- **Redundancy** - Duplicate components to eliminate single points of failure
- **Fault tolerance** - System continues operating despite component failure
- **Failover** - Automatic switching to standby system
- **Load balancing** - Distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Clustering** - Group of servers acting as a single system
- **Replication** - Synchronous or asynchronous data copying

### DR Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **RTO** | Recovery Time Objective - max acceptable downtime | 4 hours |
| **RPO** | Recovery Point Objective - max acceptable data loss | 1 hour |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time to Recovery - average recovery time | 2 hours |
| **MTBF** | Mean Time Between Failures - average uptime | 720 hours |

### DR Strategies (Cost/Speed Trade-off)
1. **Backup and Restore** - Lowest cost, highest RTO (hours to days)
2. **Pilot Light** - Minimal core infrastructure running (minutes to hours)
3. **Warm Standby** - Scaled-down copy of production (minutes)
4. **Hot Standby/Active-Active** - Full duplicate running (near-zero RTO)

## Identity and Access Management

### Authentication Methods
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** - Something you know, have, are
- **Single sign-on (SSO)** - One credential set for multiple systems
- **Federation** - Trust between identity providers (SAML, OIDC, OAuth 2.0)
- **Certificate-based** - PKI certificates for authentication
- **API keys/tokens** - Programmatic access credentials

### Access Control Models

| **Client-side** | Encrypted before sending to cloud | Maximum control, compliance |
| **Server-side** | Cloud provider encrypts at storage | Default protection, managed keys |

### Key Management
- **Provider-managed keys** - Cloud provider creates and manages keys
- **Customer-managed keys (CMK)** - Customer controls key lifecycle
