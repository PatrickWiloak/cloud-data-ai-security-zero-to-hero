# Domain 2: Security (20%)

## Overview
This domain covers implementing security controls in cloud environments, including identity and access management, data protection, network security, and compliance. Security is the second-heaviest weighted domain and overlaps with concepts tested in troubleshooting scenarios.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**[📖 NIST SP 800-63 - Digital Identity Guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/63/3/final)** - Comprehensive identity and authentication guidance

### Authentication

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
- Combines two or more of: something you know, something you have, something you are
- **Knowledge factor** - Passwords, PINs, security questions
- **Possession factor** - Hardware tokens, authenticator apps, SMS codes
- **Inherence factor** - Fingerprint, facial recognition, retina scan
- **Location factor** - Geofencing, IP restrictions
- Required for privileged accounts and sensitive operations

**Single Sign-On (SSO):**
- One set of credentials for multiple applications
- Reduces password fatigue and credential sprawl
- Central authentication point for policy enforcement
- Requires trust relationship between identity provider and service providers
- Protocols: SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC)

**Federation:**
- Trust relationships between identity providers (IdPs)
- Users authenticate with their home organization
- SAML 2.0 - XML-based, enterprise federation standard
- OIDC - Modern, JSON-based, built on OAuth 2.0
- Cross-organization access without duplicate accounts

**Certificate-Based Authentication:**
- PKI certificates for identity verification
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication
- Smart cards and hardware tokens
- Certificate lifecycle management (issuance, renewal, revocation)

### Authorization Models

**[📖 NIST SP 800-162 - ABAC Guide](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-162/final)** - Attribute-Based Access Control definition and considerations

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Access based on assigned roles within the organization
- Users assigned to roles, roles have permissions
- Simplifies management for standard organizational structures
- Example: "DBA" role has database admin permissions across all databases
- Best for: Stable organizations with well-defined job functions

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
- Access decisions based on attributes (user, resource, environment, action)
- Dynamic and context-aware (time of day, location, device type)
- More granular than RBAC but more complex to implement
- Example: "Allow access if user.department=finance AND resource.classification=internal AND time=business_hours"
- Best for: Complex environments requiring fine-grained, dynamic control

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC):**
- Access based on security labels and clearance levels
- System-enforced, not user-configurable
- Classification levels: Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret
- Best for: Government and military environments

**Discretionary Access Control (DAC):**
- Resource owner controls access permissions
- Owner grants permissions to other users
- Common in file systems (read/write/execute permissions)
- Least restrictive model

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- Secure management of elevated/administrative accounts
- Just-in-time access - temporary elevation when needed
- Session recording and monitoring
- Password vaulting and rotation
- Break-glass procedures for emergency access

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum permissions needed to perform job function
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions
- Use temporary credentials where possible
- Audit access patterns and remove unused permissions

## Access Controls

### Security Groups
- Virtual firewalls for cloud instances
- Stateful - return traffic automatically allowed
- Allow rules only (implicit deny)
- Applied at the instance level
- Common across AWS, Azure (NSGs), GCP (firewall rules)

### Network ACLs
- Subnet-level traffic filtering
- Stateless - must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound
- Both allow and deny rules
- Processed in order (rule number)
- Additional layer of defense beyond security groups

### API Access Controls
- API keys and tokens for programmatic access
- Rate limiting and throttling
- IP whitelisting for API endpoints
- OAuth 2.0 scopes for granular API permissions
- API gateway policies for centralized control

### Conditional Access
- Access decisions based on context (device, location, risk level)
- Device compliance checks before granting access
- Impossible travel detection
- Risk-based authentication (step-up when risk detected)
- Session management and token expiration

## Network Security

### Firewalls

**Cloud-Native Firewalls:**
- Security groups (instance-level, stateful)
- Network ACLs (subnet-level, stateless)
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF) - Layer 7 protection
- Cloud-based firewall services (AWS Network Firewall, Azure Firewall)

**Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
- Protects against OWASP Top 10 (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Custom rules for application-specific threats
- Rate limiting and bot detection
- Managed rule sets from security vendors

### Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

**Site-to-Site VPN:**
- Connects on-premises network to cloud VPC/VNet
- IPsec encrypted tunnel over public internet
- Redundant tunnels for high availability
- Cost-effective for moderate bandwidth needs

**Client-to-Site VPN (Remote Access):**
- Individual users connect to cloud network
- SSL/TLS or IPsec-based connections
- Split tunneling vs full tunneling
- Authentication integration with directory services

### Network Segmentation

**Virtual Private Cloud/Network:**
- Logically isolated network in the cloud
- Custom IP address ranges (CIDR blocks)
- Public and private subnets
- Route tables for traffic control
- Internet gateways for public access

**Micro-Segmentation:**
- Fine-grained security between workloads
- Zero trust network model - no implicit trust
- Policy enforcement at the workload level
- East-west traffic control (between services)
- Service mesh implementation (Istio, Linkerd)

### Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)
- **IDS** - Detects and alerts on suspicious activity
- **IPS** - Detects and blocks suspicious activity
- Network-based and host-based variants
- Signature-based and anomaly-based detection
- Cloud provider managed services available

### DDoS Protection
- Distributed Denial of Service mitigation
- Cloud providers offer built-in basic protection
- Advanced protection tiers with SLA guarantees
- Web Application Firewall integration
- Auto-scaling can absorb some attack traffic

## Data Security

### Data Classification
- **Public** - No restrictions, freely available
- **Internal** - For organizational use only
- **Confidential** - Restricted access, business-sensitive
- **Restricted/Secret** - Highest protection level, regulatory requirements

### Encryption at Rest

- **TLS 1.2/1.3** - Standard for HTTPS, API calls, web traffic
- **IPsec** - VPN tunnel encryption
- **SSH** - Secure remote administration
- **mTLS** - Mutual authentication between services

### Key Management

**Key Types:**
- **Provider-managed keys** - Cloud provider generates and manages keys
- **Customer-managed keys (CMK)** - Customer controls key lifecycle
- **Customer-supplied keys (CSEK)** - Customer provides the actual keys
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** - Customer generates, imports to provider

**Hardware Security Modules (HSM):**
- FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or 3 validated hardware
- Tamper-resistant key storage and cryptographic operations
- Required for some compliance standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Cloud HSM services: AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM

**Key Rotation:**
- Regular replacement of encryption keys
- Automated rotation (annually or more frequently)
- Old data re-encrypted with new keys or keys maintained in rotation
- Audit trail of key usage and rotation events

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Identify and protect sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial data)
- Monitor data movement and block unauthorized transfers
- Classification-based policies and rules
- Content inspection for sensitive data patterns
- Endpoint, network, and cloud DLP
