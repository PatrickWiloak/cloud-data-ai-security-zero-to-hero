# CCNA (200-301) - 12-Week Practice Plan

This plan assumes 1.5-2 hours of theory + 1 hour of hands-on lab per day. Adjust if you have less or more networking background.

The single biggest factor in passing CCNA is **subnetting fluency** + **simulator hands-on time**.

---

## Lab setup (do this in week 1, day 1)

- [ ] Install **Cisco Packet Tracer** (free, requires Cisco Networking Academy account)
- [ ] Optional: **GNS3** or **EVE-NG** if you have Cisco IOS images
- [ ] Build a baseline topology: 2 routers, 2 L3 switches, 2 L2 switches, 4 end hosts
- [ ] Save it as your default starting topology - load fresh each lab session
