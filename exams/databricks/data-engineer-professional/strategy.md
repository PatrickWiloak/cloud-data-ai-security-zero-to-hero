   - Master OPTIMIZE and VACUUM with proper retention settings
   - Learn AQE features: partition coalescing, join conversion, skew handling
   - Configure broadcast joins and understand join type selection
   - Tune Spark configuration for specific workload patterns

3. **Resources for Phase 2**
   - **[UC Best Practices](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/best-practices.html)** - Governance patterns
   - **[System Tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/system-tables/index.html)** - Monitoring
   - **[Liquid Clustering](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/clustering.html)** - Modern clustering
   - **[AQE](https://docs.databricks.com/en/optimizations/aqe.html)** - Adaptive query execution

### Phase 3: Exam Preparation (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal:** Integrate knowledge, practice scenarios, and build exam confidence.

1. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting (13% of exam)**
   - Interpret Spark UI: stages, tasks, shuffle, spill, GC time
   - Diagnose data skew and apply solutions (AQE, salting, broadcast)
   - Use DESCRIBE HISTORY and DESCRIBE DETAIL for table monitoring
   - Build monitoring queries using system tables

2. **Integration and Practice**
   - Work through scenario-based questions that span multiple domains
   - Practice designing end-to-end pipelines with governance and monitoring
   - Take timed practice exams and review incorrect answers
   - Focus on weak areas identified through practice

3. **Resources for Phase 3**
   - **[Spark UI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/)** - Understanding Spark UI
   - **[Exam Page](https://www.databricks.com/learn/certification/data-engineer-professional)** - Official exam details
   - **[Databricks Academy](https://www.databricks.com/learn)** - Advanced courses

## Study Resources

### Official Databricks Resources
- **[Databricks Academy](https://www.databricks.com/learn)** - Professional-level learning paths
- **[Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/)** - Complete platform documentation
- **[Exam Registration](https://www.databricks.com/learn/certification/data-engineer-professional)** - Official exam page

### Key Documentation Areas
- **[Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/index.html)** - Delta features and best practices
- **[Structured Streaming](https://docs.databricks.com/en/structured-streaming/index.html)** - Advanced streaming
- **[Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html)** - Governance
- **[Optimizations](https://docs.databricks.com/en/optimizations/index.html)** - Performance tuning

## Exam Tactics

### Question Strategy
1. **Read the full scenario** - Professional exam questions are longer and more nuanced
2. **Identify the core requirement** - What is the question really asking about?
3. **Eliminate wrong answers** - Look for solutions that are technically correct but do not meet the stated requirements
4. **Think at scale** - Professional-level solutions must work for large datasets
5. **Consider production readiness** - Prefer solutions with fault tolerance, monitoring, and governance

### Time Management
- **60 questions in 120 minutes** = 2 minutes per question
- **First pass (80 minutes):** Answer confident questions, flag complex scenarios
- **Second pass (30 minutes):** Return to flagged questions with fresh perspective
- **Final review (10 minutes):** Check for unanswered questions
- Scenario questions may take 3-4 minutes; offset by faster factual questions

### Key Differentiators to Study

| Concept A | Concept B | Key Difference |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| CDF batch read | CDF streaming read | Batch for one-time; streaming for continuous |
| SCD Type 1 | SCD Type 2 | Overwrite vs history preservation |
| Liquid clustering | Z-ordering | Automatic vs manual OPTIMIZE required |
| foreachBatch | standard write | foreachBatch enables MERGE in streaming |
| File notification | Directory listing | Notification scales to millions of files |
| Dynamic view | Separate tables | Dynamic view is single source of truth |
| dropDuplicates | dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark | Bounded vs unbounded state |
| OPTIMIZE | VACUUM | Compact files vs remove old files |

### Common Pitfalls
- **Forgetting watermarks on stream-stream joins** - Both sides need watermarks
- **Setting VACUUM retention too low** - Breaks time travel and concurrent reads
- **Confusing SCD Type 1 and Type 2** - Know the difference in MERGE patterns
- **Ignoring state management in streaming** - Unbounded state causes OOM errors
- **Over-partitioning** - Too many partitions create small files and degrade performance
