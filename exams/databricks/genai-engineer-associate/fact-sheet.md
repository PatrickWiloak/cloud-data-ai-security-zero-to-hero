## Domain 1: RAG Application Design (30%)

### RAG Architecture

**[📖 RAG Overview](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html)** - RAG on Databricks
**[📖 AI Cookbook](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/tutorials/ai-cookbook/index.html)** - RAG tutorial
**[📖 Vector Search](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/vector-search.html)** - Vector database

**Key Facts:**
- RAG combines retrieval from a knowledge base with LLM generation
- RAG reduces hallucination by grounding responses in retrieved documents
- RAG architecture components:
  1. Document processing pipeline (ingest, chunk, embed)
  2. Vector store (index and search embeddings)
  3. Retriever (find relevant documents for a query)
  4. Generator (LLM produces answer using retrieved context)
- RAG vs fine-tuning:
  - RAG: use when knowledge changes frequently, no training needed
  - Fine-tuning: use when you need to change model behavior/style
  - Prompt engineering: use for simple instruction-following tasks

### Chunking Strategies

**[📖 Document Processing](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/tutorials/ai-cookbook/quality-iteration/chunking.html)** - Chunking approaches

**Key Facts:**
- Fixed-size chunking: split by character/token count (simple, fast)
- Recursive character splitting: split by separators hierarchically
- Semantic chunking: split by meaning boundaries
- Document-aware chunking: respect document structure (headers, paragraphs)
- Chunk size considerations:
  - Smaller chunks: more precise retrieval, may lose context
  - Larger chunks: more context, may include irrelevant information
  - Typical range: 256-1024 tokens
- Chunk overlap: 10-20% overlap prevents losing context at boundaries
- Metadata enrichment: add source, title, section to each chunk

### Embedding Models

**[📖 Foundation Model APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html)** - Model serving
**[📖 External Models](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/external-models/index.html)** - Third-party model access

**Key Facts:**
- Embedding models convert text to dense vector representations
- Databricks-hosted embedding models (e.g., BGE, GTE)
- External model endpoints (OpenAI, Cohere embeddings)
- Embedding dimensions affect storage and retrieval performance
- Similarity metrics: cosine similarity, dot product, Euclidean distance
- Embedding model selection: domain relevance, dimension size, latency

### Retrieval Strategies

**Key Facts:**
- Similarity search: find nearest vectors to query embedding
- Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR): balance relevance and diversity
- Filtered search: combine vector similarity with metadata filters
- Hybrid search: combine dense (vector) and sparse (keyword) retrieval
- Re-ranking: use a cross-encoder to re-score retrieved documents
- Top-k selection: number of documents to retrieve (typically 3-10)
- Multi-query retrieval: generate multiple query variations for better recall
