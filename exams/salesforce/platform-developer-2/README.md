## Overview

The Platform Developer II (PDII) credential validates advanced programmatic skills on the Salesforce platform. Candidates demonstrate mastery of **Apex** (advanced async patterns, Stub API, dynamic Apex, design patterns), **integrations** (REST/SOAP, Platform Events, Change Data Capture, Named Credentials, External Services), **Lightning Web Components** (events, reactivity, performance), **testing** (mocks, dependency injection), and **deployment** (SFDX, 2GP packaging, Metadata API).

PDII is the next step after Platform Developer I. Historically the credential included a coding assignment / superbadge component, but as of 2026 the credential is awarded after a single proctored multiple-choice exam (Salesforce retired the programming assignment requirement). Always verify the latest format on the official credential page before scheduling.

## Exam Domains

| # | Domain | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Salesforce Fundamentals | 5% |
| 2 | Data Modeling and Management | 10% |
| 3 | Process Automation, Logic, and Integration | 35% |
| 4 | User Interface | 20% |
| 5 | Testing, Debugging, and Deployment | 20% |
| 6 | Performance | 10% |

The exam emphasizes **architectural decision-making** under governor-limit constraints. Expect long code samples, ambiguous-looking choices, and questions where multiple answers compile but only one scales.

## Recommended Study Time

| Background | Estimated Prep Time |
|---|---|
| PDI + 2+ years Apex experience | 6-8 weeks |
| PDI + occasional Apex work | 10-12 weeks |
| PDI just earned, limited project work | 14-16 weeks |
| Targeting PDII without strong PDI fundamentals | Take PDI seriously first |

PDII is not a memorization exam. The questions reward people who have shipped Apex to production and dealt with governor limits, mixed DML, recursion, deserialization, and integration latency.

## Prerequisites

- **Platform Developer I credential** (required, not optional - PDII is awarded only after PDI is in good standing)
- 1-2+ years of hands-on Apex / LWC / SOQL development
- Comfort with REST APIs, JSON, async patterns, and design patterns
- Familiarity with SFDX, scratch orgs, and source-driven development

---

## Hands-on Setup

- **[Salesforce Developer Edition org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup)** - free, permanent
- **[Salesforce CLI / `sf` binary](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli)** - source-driven dev
- **[VS Code with Salesforce Extensions Pack](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode)** - the IDE
- **[Trailhead PDII Trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-developer-ii-credential)** - official prep
- **[Apex Specialist Superbadge](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/superbadges/superbadge_apex)** - prerequisite-level
- **[Advanced Apex Specialist Superbadge](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/superbadges/superbadge_advanced_apex_specialist)** - core PDII material
- **[Apex Patterns and Best Practices](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/CumulusCI)** - real-world reference codebase

You **cannot** pass PDII without writing real Apex against a real org. Plan to ship at least 3-5 non-trivial integrations / async pipelines during prep.

## Companion Materials

- **[Platform Developer I](../platform-developer-1/)** - foundational developer cert; PDII assumes mastery
- **[Salesforce Administrator](../administrator/)** - configuration foundation referenced in declarative-vs-programmatic questions
- **[Integration Patterns Guide](https://architect.salesforce.com/decision-guides/integration-patterns)** - Salesforce architect reference for the integration domain (35% of PDII)

---

## Notes

- The 2026 PDII format is multiple-choice only. Salesforce previously required a "programming assignment" (Trailhead superbadge) component to earn the credential; this requirement was retired. Confirm the current format on the credential page before booking.
- PDI must be active (passed all maintenance modules) before PDII is awarded.
- Maintain PDII via free release exams ~3 times per year on Trailhead.
