6. **Audit Logs**: Enable and monitor Admin Activity and Data Access logs
7. **Query Optimization**: Use efficient queries in Logs Explorer
8. **Access Control**: Restrict log access using IAM permissions

### Error Reporting Best Practices
1. **Error Context**: Include relevant context in error messages
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper exception handling in applications
3. **Notification Setup**: Configure alerts for new error types
4. **Regular Review**: Check Error Reporting dashboard regularly
5. **Resolution Tracking**: Mark errors as resolved to track fixes
6. **Integration**: Ensure proper error reporting library integration
7. **Filtering**: Use filters to focus on critical errors

### Cloud Trace Best Practices
1. **Sampling Rate**: Adjust based on traffic volume and analysis needs
2. **Custom Spans**: Add spans for important application operations
