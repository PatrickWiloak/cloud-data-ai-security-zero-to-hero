## Google Cloud Architecture Framework

The GCP Architecture Framework provides five pillars for designing excellent cloud architectures:

### 1. Operational Excellence
**Definition**: Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continually improve processes.

**Key Principles**:
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Deployment Manager)
- Automated CI/CD pipelines (Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy)
- Centralized logging and monitoring (Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring)
- Incident management and blameless postmortems
- Regular performance reviews and optimization cycles

**Best Practices**:
- Use version control for all infrastructure code
- Implement comprehensive observability (logs, metrics, traces)
- Automate operational tasks with Cloud Functions or Cloud Scheduler
- Use Cloud Operations suite for unified monitoring
- Implement SLOs, SLIs, and error budgets
- Conduct regular disaster recovery drills

**Exam Tip**: Questions often present operational challenges requiring automation solutions. Always consider managed services and automation over manual processes.

### 2. Security, Privacy, and Compliance
**Definition**: Protect data, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk management.

**Key Principles**:
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Least privilege access (IAM, service accounts, workload identity)
- Zero trust security model
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Continuous security monitoring and threat detection

**Best Practices**:
- Use VPC Service Controls for data exfiltration protection
- Implement Binary Authorization for container security
- Use Cloud KMS for encryption key management
- Enable Security Command Center for security posture management
- Implement Cloud Armor for DDoS protection
- Use Private Google Access and VPC peering
- Audit with Cloud Audit Logs and Access Transparency

**Exam Tip**: Security questions often involve multiple layers. Look for answers that implement defense in depth rather than single security controls.

### 3. Reliability
**Definition**: Design systems that perform their intended function correctly and consistently when expected.

**Key Principles**:
- Eliminate single points of failure
- Design for failure with graceful degradation
- Multi-region and multi-zone deployments
- Automated health checks and self-healing
- Circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns

**Best Practices**:
- Deploy across multiple zones (99.95% SLA) or regions (99.99% SLA)
- Use Global Load Balancing for automatic failover
- Implement health checks at multiple levels
- Use Cloud SQL HA configuration with automatic failover
- Design for eventual consistency in distributed systems
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use Cloud Spanner for globally consistent databases
- Test failure scenarios with chaos engineering

**Exam Tip**: High availability questions require understanding of zonal vs regional vs multi-regional resources and their SLA implications.

### 4. Performance and Scalability
**Definition**: Systems efficiently use resources to meet requirements and scale to meet demand.

**Key Principles**:
- Horizontal scaling over vertical scaling
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical paths
- Caching at multiple layers
- Database optimization and sharding
- Autoscaling based on metrics

**Best Practices**:
- Use Cloud CDN for static content caching
- Implement Memorystore (Redis/Memcached) for application caching
- Use Cloud Load Balancing for traffic distribution

- Use Pub/Sub for asynchronous decoupling
- Implement connection pooling (Cloud SQL Proxy)
- Use appropriate storage classes (Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive)

**Exam Tip**: Performance questions often involve caching strategies and database optimization. Know when to use each caching layer.

### 5. Cost Optimization
**Definition**: Deliver business value at the lowest price point while meeting requirements.

**Key Principles**:
- Right-sizing resources based on actual usage
- Committed use discounts for predictable workloads
- Preemptible/Spot VMs for fault-tolerant workloads
- Automated resource scheduling
- Storage lifecycle management

**Best Practices**:
- Use Committed Use Discounts (1-year: 25%, 3-year: 52% savings)
- Use Sustained Use Discounts (automatic 30% discount)
- Use Preemptible VMs (up to 80% savings) for batch workloads
- Implement Cloud Storage lifecycle policies
- Use BigQuery flat-rate pricing for predictable costs
- Enable Cloud Storage Autoclass for automatic tier optimization
- Use custom machine types for precise resource allocation

```

**When to Use**:
- Complex applications requiring independent scaling of components
- Large teams working on different business capabilities
- Need for technology diversity (different languages, frameworks)
- Frequent, independent deployments
- Different scaling requirements per service
- Need for failure isolation
- Long-term system evolution and maintenance

**When NOT to Use**:
- Simple applications with low complexity
- Small teams without DevOps expertise
- Tight latency requirements (network overhead)
- Strong consistency requirements across services
- Limited operational capabilities

**Design Considerations**:
1. **Service Boundaries**: Define clear boundaries based on business capabilities, not technical layers
2. **Data Management**: Each service owns its data; avoid shared databases
3. **Communication**: Use synchronous (REST/gRPC) for read operations, asynchronous (Pub/Sub) for writes
4. **Resilience**: Implement circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries
5. **Observability**: Centralized logging, distributed tracing (Cloud Trace)
6. **API Versioning**: Maintain backward compatibility with versioned APIs
7. **Security**: Implement service-to-service authentication (Workload Identity)

**Exam Tip**: For microservices questions, look for requirements around independent scaling, team autonomy, and polyglot development. Choose GKE for complex orchestration needs and Cloud Run for simpler serverless containers.

### Event-Driven Architecture

```

**Event-Driven Patterns**:

1. **Event Notification**: Simple notification that something occurred
   - Example: User registered -> Send welcome email
   - Use: Cloud Functions triggered by Pub/Sub

2. **Event-Carried State Transfer**: Events contain full state changes
   - Example: Order placed with complete order details
   - Use: Multiple services update their local caches

3. **Event Sourcing**: Store all state changes as sequence of events
   - Example: Bank account transactions as event log
   - Use: Dataflow to process events, Cloud Spanner for event store

4. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate read and write models
   - Example: Write to Cloud SQL, replicate to Firestore for reads
   - Use: Pub/Sub to synchronize between write and read models

**When to Use**:
- Real-time data processing requirements (IoT, clickstream)
- Need for loose coupling between systems
- High scalability with variable workloads
- Asynchronous workflows that don't need immediate response
- Multiple consumers need same data
- Building reactive systems
- Integrating heterogeneous systems

**When NOT to Use**:
- Need for immediate synchronous responses
- Simple request-response patterns
- Strong consistency requirements across operations
- Limited number of events (overhead not justified)

**Design Considerations**:
1. **Idempotency**: Design event handlers to be idempotent (Pub/Sub has at-least-once delivery)
2. **Ordering**: Use message ordering in Pub/Sub when sequence matters
3. **Dead Letter Queues**: Configure for failed message handling
4. **Event Schema**: Define clear event schemas and versioning strategy
5. **Monitoring**: Track message age, undelivered messages, and processing latency
6. **Replay**: Design for event replay capability for recovery scenarios
7. **Filtering**: Use Pub/Sub filtering to reduce unnecessary processing

**Pub/Sub Best Practices**:
- Use topics for event types, subscriptions for consumers
- Enable message retention (up to 31 days) for replay
- Set appropriate acknowledgment deadlines (default 10s, max 600s)
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Configure dead letter topics for poisoned messages
- Use push subscriptions for Cloud Functions/Cloud Run, pull for batch processing

**Exam Tip**: For event-driven questions, identify loose coupling requirements and asynchronous processing needs. Pub/Sub is the foundation for most event-driven architectures on GCP. Remember: Pub/Sub for messaging, Eventarc for event routing across GCP services.

### Serverless Architecture

**When to Use Serverless**:
- Variable or unpredictable workloads with spiky traffic
- Rapid development and deployment requirements
- Event-driven processing (file uploads, database changes, Pub/Sub messages)
- Cost optimization for sporadic or low-traffic usage
- Minimal operational overhead requirements
- Quick prototyping and MVPs
- Stateless applications
- API backends for mobile/web applications

**When NOT to Use Serverless**:
- Long-running batch jobs (use Compute Engine or Batch)
- Applications requiring persistent connections
- Workloads needing specific hardware (GPUs) - use GKE or GCE
- Applications with very tight latency requirements (cold starts)
- Stateful applications (externalize state first)
- Legacy applications that can't be containerized

**Serverless Best Practices**:
1. **Minimize Cold Starts**:
   - Keep function code small and dependencies minimal
   - Use Cloud Run min instances for critical services
   - Implement lazy loading for heavy libraries
   - Consider 2nd gen Cloud Functions for better cold start performance

2. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Reuse connections (database, external APIs) across invocations
   - Use global variables for initialization code
   - Implement caching (Memorystore, in-memory cache)
   - Configure appropriate memory allocation

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Right-size memory allocation (CPU scales with memory)
   - Use Cloud Scheduler to keep warm if needed (vs. min instances)
   - Set appropriate timeouts to avoid runaway costs
   - Monitor and optimize function execution time

4. **Security**:
   - Use Workload Identity for GCP service access
   - Implement least privilege IAM roles
   - Use Secret Manager for sensitive data
   - Enable VPC Service Controls for data protection

5. **Reliability**:
   - Implement idempotency for event-driven functions
   - Use dead letter queues for failed processing
   - Set appropriate retry policies
   - Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies

**Exam Tip**: For serverless questions, consider the execution time limits, cold start impacts, and whether the workload is event-driven or request-driven. Cloud Functions for simple event handling, Cloud Run for containerized applications with HTTP/Pub/Sub triggers, App Engine for traditional web applications.

**Multi-Cloud Connectivity Options**:
| Option | Bandwidth | Use Case | Cost | Latency |
|--------|-----------|----------|------|---------|
| **VPN Gateway** | Up to 3 Gbps per tunnel | Low bandwidth, test | $ | Higher |
| **Partner Interconnect** | 50 Mbps - 10 Gbps | Moderate bandwidth | $$ | Medium |
| **Dedicated Interconnect** | 10 Gbps or 100 Gbps | High bandwidth, production | $$$ | Lowest |

**When to Use Hybrid/Multi-Cloud**:
- Regulatory requirements for data residency (GDPR, data sovereignty)
- Existing significant on-premises investments
- Enterprise multi-cloud strategy
- Gradual cloud migration approach
- Application dependencies on on-premises systems
- Disaster recovery across providers
- Avoiding vendor lock-in
- Burst to cloud for peak demand

**When NOT to Use**:
- Simple cloud-native applications
- No existing on-premises infrastructure
- Limited operational expertise for multi-cloud management
- Cost-sensitive projects (multi-cloud adds complexity and cost)

- Cloud Spanner: Automatic, transparent failover
- Manual promotion of read replica to primary (if needed)

### Design Principles for High Availability

1. **Eliminate Single Points of Failure**: Use multi-zone/multi-region deployment
2. **Implement Redundancy**: N+1 or N+2 redundancy for critical components
3. **Use Managed Services**: Leverage GCP managed services with built-in HA
4. **Design for Failure**: Assume components will fail and design accordingly
5. **Implement Health Checks**: Multiple levels (service, application, infrastructure)
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain partial functionality during outages
7. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures in microservices
8. **Timeouts and Retries**: Implement with exponential backoff
9. **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing systems with automatic restart
10. **Regular Testing**: Conduct DR drills and chaos engineering exercises

### Scalability Design Principles

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Design for scale-out rather than scale-up
   - Use managed instance groups with autoscaling
   - Deploy stateless applications
   - Use load balancers for traffic distribution

2. **Stateless Components**: Separate state from compute
   - Externalize session state (Memorystore, Firestore)
   - Use shared storage (Cloud Storage, Filestore)
   - Design for ephemeral compute instances

3. **Caching Layers**: Implement multi-level caching
   - **CDN Layer**: Cloud CDN for static content
   - **Application Cache**: Memorystore (Redis/Memcached)
   - **Database Cache**: Query result caching in BigQuery
   - **Browser Cache**: HTTP cache headers

4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use queues for non-real-time work
   - Pub/Sub for event-driven processing
   - Cloud Tasks for scheduled/deferred tasks
   - Dataflow for batch/stream processing

5. **Database Optimization**:
   - Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
   - Database sharding for write-heavy workloads
   - Cloud Spanner for horizontal scalability with ACID
   - Connection pooling (Cloud SQL Proxy)

6. **Auto-scaling**: Use managed auto-scaling services
   - GKE Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
   - Cloud Run automatic scaling (0 to 1000s)
   - Compute Engine autoscaling based on CPU, load balancing, custom metrics

7. **Load Distribution**: Implement effective load balancing
   - Global Load Balancing for multi-region distribution
   - Regional Load Balancing for regional resources
   - Internal Load Balancing for internal services

### Security Design Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
   - Network security (VPC, firewall rules, Cloud Armor)
   - Application security (IAM, service accounts, Workload Identity)
   - Data security (encryption, VPC Service Controls, DLP API)

2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions
   - Use predefined roles over primitive roles
   - Create custom roles for specific needs
   - Service accounts for service-to-service communication

3. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
   - BeyondCorp Enterprise for context-aware access
   - Certificate-based authentication
   - Verify every request regardless of network location

4. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data at rest and in transit
   - Default encryption at rest for all GCP storage
   - Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with Cloud KMS
   - TLS/SSL for data in transit

5. **Security by Design**: Build security into architecture
   - Security review in architecture phase
   - Threat modeling exercises
   - Security Command Center for posture management

6. **Segregation of Duties**: Separate critical roles
   - Separate development, staging, production projects
   - Use organization policies for guardrails
   - Implement approval workflows for sensitive operations

7. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - Cloud Audit Logs for all API calls
   - VPC Flow Logs for network traffic
   - Export logs to BigQuery for analysis
   - Set up alerting for anomalous activities

### Cost Optimization Principles
1. **Right-Sizing**: Match resources to actual needs
2. **Committed Use**: Purchase commitments for predictable workloads
3. **Spot/Preemptible**: Use for fault-tolerant workloads
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Archive or delete unused data
5. **Serverless First**: Leverage serverless for variable workloads
6. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Track costs continuously
7. **Resource Scheduling**: Shut down non-production during off-hours

## Best Practices

### Architecture Documentation Best Practices
1. **Architecture Diagrams**: Use standard notation (C4, UML)
2. **Decision Records**: Document key architectural decisions
3. **Component Descriptions**: Detail each component's purpose
4. **Data Flow Diagrams**: Show data movement through system
5. **Security Architecture**: Document security controls
6. **Deployment Architecture**: Show deployment topology
7. **Cost Estimates**: Include TCO calculations
8. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Document performance, security, etc.

### Requirement Gathering Best Practices
1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Understand business needs
2. **Current State Analysis**: Document existing architecture
3. **Constraint Identification**: Identify technical and business constraints
4. **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria
5. **Prioritization**: Rank requirements by importance
6. **Trade-off Analysis**: Document design trade-offs
7. **Assumption Documentation**: Record all assumptions

### Migration Planning Best Practices
1. **Assessment Phase**: Comprehensive inventory and analysis
2. **Migration Strategy**: Choose appropriate strategy per workload
3. **Pilot Projects**: Start with low-risk applications
4. **Phased Approach**: Migrate in manageable phases
5. **Testing Strategy**: Validate each migration phase
6. **Rollback Planning**: Prepare for potential rollback
7. **Training and Documentation**: Prepare team for new environment
8. **Post-Migration Optimization**: Optimize after migration

### Data Warehouse with BigQuery
**Purpose**: Serverless, highly scalable data warehouse for analytics

**Best Practices**:
1. **Table Design**:
   - Use partitioning (date, timestamp, ingestion time) for large tables
   - Use clustering (up to 4 columns) for frequently filtered columns
   - Denormalize data for better query performance
   - Use nested and repeated fields for hierarchical data

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Use `_PARTITIONTIME` or partition column in WHERE clause
   - Avoid SELECT * (specify columns explicitly)
   - Use approximate aggregation functions (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT)
   - Materialize frequently accessed query results

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use partitioned tables to reduce data scanned
   - Set table expiration for temporary data
   - Use clustering for filter and aggregate queries
   - Consider flat-rate pricing for predictable costs (>$40K/month)
   - Use BI Engine for caching frequently accessed data

4. **Performance**:
   - Use batch loading over streaming for large data volumes
   - Enable result caching (24 hours free)
   - Avoid self-joins (use window functions instead)
   - Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA for metadata queries

```

**Example ADR**:

### ADR-001: Use Cloud Spanner for Global E-Commerce Database

**Date**: 2024-10-11
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
- E-commerce platform needs globally consistent database
- Support 50K requests/second with <100ms latency
- Multi-region deployment (US, EU, Asia)
- Strong consistency for inventory and orders
- 99.99% availability requirement

**Decision**:
Use Cloud Spanner with multi-region configuration (nam-eur-asia3) for transactional database.

**Consequences**:
**Positive**:
- Strong consistency across all regions
- Automatic horizontal scaling
- 99.999% SLA
- No need for complex replication logic
- Global SQL queries

**Negative**:
- Higher cost than Cloud SQL (~10x for equivalent workload)
- Limited to 10,000 processing units per instance
- More complex schema design (avoid hotspots)
- Learning curve for interleaved tables

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Cloud SQL with cross-region replicas**:
   - Pro: Lower cost, familiar PostgreSQL/MySQL
   - Con: Eventual consistency, manual failover, no global transactions

2. **Firestore multi-region**:
   - Pro: Lower cost, good for document model
   - Con: Limited query capabilities, eventual consistency option only

3. **Self-managed MySQL with Vitess**:
   - Pro: More control, potentially lower cost
   - Con: Operational overhead, need to manage sharding

**Trade-offs**:
- **Cost (+50%)**: Spanner is expensive but eliminates complex application logic for consistency
- **Performance (Excellent)**: Sub-100ms globally, horizontal scaling
- **Complexity (Lower)**: Managed service reduces operational burden
- **Security (Excellent)**: Built-in encryption, IAM integration, audit logging

**Cost Analysis**:
- Cloud Spanner (1000 PUs): $100K/month
- Alternative (Cloud SQL HA + replicas): $40K/month + application complexity
- **Decision**: Accept higher cost for simplified architecture and better SLAs

**Sources**:
- Cloud Storage (object finalized, deleted)
- Pub/Sub messages
- Cloud Audit Logs (any API call)
- Custom events via Pub/Sub

**Example**:
```
Cloud Storage (new file) → Eventarc → Cloud Run (process file)
BigQuery (job complete) → Eventarc → Cloud Function (send notification)
```

**Benefits**:
- Declarative event routing
- No code to poll or listen
- Automatic retries
- Built-in filtering

## Exam Preparation Strategy

### How to Approach Case Study Questions

**Step-by-Step Approach**:

1. **Read Carefully** (5 minutes):
   - Identify business requirements (availability, scale, cost)
   - Note technical constraints (existing systems, budget, team skills)
   - Highlight compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
   - Understand non-functional requirements (RTO, RPO, latency)

2. **Categorize Requirements**:
   - **Must-Have**: Core business requirements
   - **Should-Have**: Important but not critical
   - **Nice-to-Have**: Future enhancements

3. **Identify Patterns**:
   - High availability → Multi-region, redundancy
   - Low latency → CDN, caching, regional deployment
   - Global scale → Cloud Spanner, Global Load Balancing
   - Real-time processing → Pub/Sub, Dataflow
   - Analytics → BigQuery
   - Cost-sensitive → Serverless, preemptible VMs, lifecycle policies

4. **Service Selection**:
   - Start with compute layer (GKE, Cloud Run, Compute Engine)
   - Choose database based on consistency needs (Spanner, Cloud SQL, Firestore, Bigtable)
   - Add caching where appropriate (CDN, Memorystore)
   - Include messaging for async processing (Pub/Sub)
   - Consider security and compliance services

5. **Validate Design**:
   - Does it meet availability SLA?
   - Can it scale to required load?
   - Is it within budget?
   - Does it satisfy compliance requirements?
   - Are there single points of failure?

### Common Exam Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-Engineering**:
   - Don't choose complex solutions when simple ones suffice
   - Example: Using Cloud Spanner for a simple web app with regional users → Use Cloud SQL instead

2. **Ignoring Costs**:
   - Always consider cost implications
   - Look for cost optimization opportunities (CUDs, preemptible VMs, lifecycle policies)

3. **Missing Compliance Requirements**:
   - HIPAA → BAA, CMEK, VPC Service Controls, Healthcare API
   - PCI-DSS → Separate project, VPC Service Controls, audit logging
   - GDPR → Data residency, DLP API, right to deletion

4. **Forgetting High Availability**:
   - Single-zone deployments have no SLA
   - Always use multi-zone for production
   - Consider multi-region for mission-critical systems

5. **Wrong Database Choice**:
   - Strong consistency globally → Cloud Spanner
   - Relational, regional → Cloud SQL
   - Document model → Firestore
   - High-throughput, low-latency → Bigtable
   - Analytics → BigQuery

6. **Ignoring Existing Constraints**:
   - Legacy systems that must be integrated
   - Team skills and operational capabilities
   - Budget limitations
   - Timeline constraints

## Study Tips

### Architecture Design Practice
1. **Case Study Analysis**: Work through official GCP case studies (Mountkirk Games, Dress4Win, TerramEarth)
2. **Draw Architectures**: Practice creating architecture diagrams using standard notation
3. **Cost Calculations**: Estimate costs for different designs using GCP Pricing Calculator
4. **Trade-off Analysis**: Compare multiple approaches for same problem (cost vs. performance vs. complexity)
5. **Security Review**: Identify security gaps in architectures and propose remediations
6. **Scalability Analysis**: Determine scaling bottlenecks and design for horizontal scalability
7. **Migration Planning**: Create detailed migration plans for lift-and-shift, replatform, and refactor scenarios

### Key Concepts to Master
1. **Service Selection**: Know when to use each GCP service and trade-offs between alternatives
2. **Architecture Patterns**: Understand common patterns (microservices, event-driven, serverless) and anti-patterns
3. **Trade-offs**: Balance performance, cost, complexity, and security in every design decision
4. **NFRs**: Design for non-functional requirements (availability, latency, throughput, durability)
5. **Migration Strategies**: 6 Rs (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Repurchase, Retire, Retain) and when to use each
6. **Cost Modeling**: Calculate and optimize TCO including compute, storage, networking, and licensing
7. **Compliance**: Design for regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2)

### Common Exam Topics
1. **Scenario-Based Design**: Designing complete architectures for given business scenarios with constraints
2. **Service Selection**: Choosing appropriate GCP services based on requirements
3. **Migration Planning**: Planning and executing cloud migrations with minimal downtime
4. **High Availability and DR**: Designing for multi-region failover, RTO/RPO targets
5. **Cost Optimization**: Right-sizing, committed use discounts, preemptible VMs, storage lifecycle
6. **Security and Compliance**: VPC Service Controls, CMEK, IAM, audit logging
7. **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies, database optimization, CDN usage
8. **Hybrid and Multi-Cloud**: Anthos, VPN vs. Interconnect, consistent management

### Exam Day Tips
1. **Time Management**: 2 hours for 50 questions = ~2.4 minutes per question
2. **Read Carefully**: Pay attention to constraints (budget, timeline, existing systems, compliance)
3. **Eliminate Wrong Answers**: Often easier to eliminate 2-3 obviously wrong answers
4. **Look for Keywords**: "Global", "low latency", "strong consistency", "cost-effective", "serverless"
5. **Consider Trade-offs**: Best answer often balances multiple concerns
6. **Trust Your Knowledge**: Don't second-guess yourself too much
7. **Flag and Review**: Flag uncertain questions and review if time permits

## Migration Strategies (6 Rs)

### 1. Rehost (Lift-and-Shift)
- Move as-is to cloud
- Minimal changes
- Fast migration
- Limited cloud benefits
- **GCP Tools**: Migrate for Compute Engine

### 2. Replatform (Lift-and-Reshape)
- Minor optimizations
- Use managed services
- Moderate effort
- Some cloud benefits
- **Example**: Move to Cloud SQL instead of self-managed DB

### 3. Refactor (Re-architect)
- Redesign for cloud-native
- Maximum cloud benefits
- Highest effort
- Best long-term approach
- **Example**: Monolith to microservices

### 4. Repurchase (Replace)
- Move to SaaS
- Abandon custom software
- Fast transition
- Recurring costs
- **Example**: Move to Google Workspace

### 5. Retire
- Decommission unnecessary applications
- Reduce maintenance
- Cost savings
- Simplify landscape

### 6. Retain
- Keep on-premises
- Not ready for migration
- Regulatory constraints
- Migrate later
