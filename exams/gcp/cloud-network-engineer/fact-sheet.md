## Key Networking Concepts

### Network Latency & Performance

**Latency Optimization:**
- Use Premium Network Tier for global applications
- Deploy resources in multiple regions close to users
- Enable Cloud CDN for static content
- Use HTTP/2 and connection multiplexing
- Optimize backend response times

**Bandwidth Optimization:**
- Right-size interconnect connections
- Use compression for HTTP traffic
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize egress costs
- Use internal IPs for intra-region traffic

### High Availability Patterns

**Multi-Zone Deployments:**
- Distribute instances across zones
- Use regional managed instance groups
- Configure health checks appropriately
- Implement graceful connection draining
- Test failover scenarios regularly

**Multi-Region Architectures:**
- Global load balancing for traffic distribution
- Regional backend services for isolation
- Cross-region VPN or Interconnect
- DNS-based failover strategies
- Data replication considerations

### Cost Optimization

**Network Cost Reduction:**
- Use internal IPs for intra-region communication
- Minimize egress to internet
- Choose appropriate network tier (Premium vs Standard)
- Right-size interconnect bandwidth
- Optimize NAT IP allocation

**Load Balancer Cost Optimization:**
- Consolidate forwarding rules where possible
- Use instance groups instead of instance targets
- Implement efficient health check intervals
- Consider regional vs global load balancing needs
