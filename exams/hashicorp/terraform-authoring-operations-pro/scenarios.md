# HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Authoring and Operations Advanced - Real-World Scenarios

Each scenario models a real production situation similar to what you will encounter on the exam. Work through the "Question" first, then read the "Answer" to validate your thinking. The exam tests Terraform 1.6, so the answers stick to features available in 1.6. Objective numbers refer to the six exam objectives (see [README.md](./README.md)).

Scenarios by objective: 1 lifecycle (2, 3, 4), 2 dynamic configuration (8), 3 collaborative workflows (9), 4 modules (1, 11), 5 providers (10), 6 HCP Terraform (5, 6, 7, 12).

## Scenario 1: Refactor count to for_each Without Destroying

**Question:** A module has `resource "aws_iam_user" "users" { count = length(var.user_names) name = var.user_names[count.index] }`. Users are referenced by index in state (`aws_iam_user.users[0]`). A developer adds a new name at the start of the list. A plan wants to destroy and recreate every user because indices shifted. How do you refactor safely?

**Answer:** Convert to `for_each = toset(var.user_names)`. This keys resources by the string name rather than index, so adding or removing users only affects the delta. To preserve existing state, add `moved` blocks:

```hcl
moved {
  from = aws_iam_user.users[0]
  to   = aws_iam_user.users["alice"]
}
```

Repeat for each existing user. After apply, the `moved` blocks can remain in code or be removed in a follow-up commit.

## Scenario 2: Stuck State Lock

**Question:** A CI pipeline crashed mid-apply against an S3 backend with a DynamoDB lock. The next plan fails with `Error acquiring the state lock`. The lock ID is shown. The workspace has been stuck for 40 minutes. How do you recover?

**Answer:** First, verify no apply is actually still running. Check the CI job status, check CloudTrail for recent `dynamodb:UpdateItem` on the lock table, and check `aws_s3_object` last-modified times on the `tfstate` file. If the lock is genuinely orphaned, run `terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID`. Immediately follow with `terraform plan -refresh-only` to confirm state integrity. If the prior apply half-completed, reconcile drift before another apply.

## Scenario 3: Import a Manually Created VPC

**Question:** Your team accidentally created a production VPC via the AWS console. It must now be managed by Terraform with zero downtime. How do you bring it under management?

**Answer:** Use `import` blocks (Terraform 1.5+) for a declarative workflow.

```hcl
import {
  to = aws_vpc.prod
  id = "vpc-0abc123"
}

# no resource "aws_vpc" "prod" block yet: Terraform generates it
```

Then run `terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf`. Terraform only generates configuration for import targets that have **no** resource block, so do not write a placeholder. Review `generated.tf`, clean it up (remove conflicting or computed arguments, replace literals with references), and commit. Run `terraform plan` again: it should show 1 to import and 0 to add, change or destroy. Then `terraform apply` records the import into state. (Config generation was experimental in 1.5 and 1.6; `terraform import aws_vpc.prod vpc-0abc123` with a hand-written block is the fallback.)

## Scenario 4: Split Monolith into Dev and Prod

**Question:** A single workspace manages both dev and prod VPCs, RDS instances, and IAM roles. Leadership wants separate state files per environment for blast-radius isolation. You cannot take downtime. What is the migration plan?

**Answer:**

1. Create two new workspaces (`dev-infra`, `prod-infra`) with their own S3 backends or HCP workspaces.
2. `terraform state pull > monolith.tfstate` from the existing workspace.
3. For each dev resource, `terraform state mv -state=monolith.tfstate -state-out=dev.tfstate aws_vpc.dev_vpc aws_vpc.dev_vpc`. Repeat for prod.
4. `terraform state push dev.tfstate` into the new dev workspace. Same for prod.
5. Split the HCL source into `dev/` and `prod/` directories matching each workspace.
6. Run `terraform plan` in each new workspace. It must show zero changes. If not, stop and reconcile.
7. Once both show clean, empty the original workspace state and archive it.

## Scenario 5: Sentinel Policy Blocking Public S3

**Question:** Security requires that no `aws_s3_bucket` in production has `block_public_acls=false`. Write a Sentinel policy, test it, and explain the enforcement level you would choose.

**Answer:**

```python
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

s3_buckets = filter tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
  rc.type is "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" and
  rc.mode is "managed" and
  (rc.change.actions contains "create" or rc.change.actions contains "update")
}

main = rule {
  all s3_buckets as _, rc {
    rc.change.after.block_public_acls is true and
    rc.change.after.block_public_policy is true and
    rc.change.after.ignore_public_acls is true and
    rc.change.after.restrict_public_buckets is true
  }
}
```

Test with `sentinel test -run block-public-s3` using mocks generated from `terraform show -json`. Set enforcement to `hard-mandatory` in production policy sets. This prevents any override, including by org owners, except through a code fix.

## Scenario 6: OIDC Dynamic Credentials

**Question:** Your security team has banned long-lived AWS keys in HCP Terraform. Migrate an existing workspace to OIDC dynamic credentials without causing any failed runs during migration.

**Answer:**

1. Create an IAM OIDC provider in AWS for `app.terraform.io`.
2. Create an IAM role trusting that OIDC provider with a condition on `sub` matching your organization and workspace.
3. Set workspace variables: `TFC_AWS_PROVIDER_AUTH=true`, `TFC_AWS_RUN_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::...:role/tfc-role`.
4. Remove `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` workspace variables.
5. Run a speculative plan to validate.
6. If plan succeeds, you are migrated. If not, re-add the static vars, debug the trust policy, and retry.

The order matters: if you remove the static vars before the dynamic path works, you get failed runs. Do not leave both in place: HashiCorp warns that other credential settings for the provider can interfere with dynamic credentials, and you would not know which identity a run actually used. A clean finish is dynamic credentials only, with the trust policy bound to the workspace's `sub` claim.

## Scenario 7: Drift Detection on Critical Workspace

**Question:** Your ops team wants to know within an hour if someone makes a console change to a production resource. How do you enable this with HCP Terraform and what are the caveats?

**Answer:** Enable **health assessments** on the workspace (drift detection, plus continuous validation of `check` blocks). HCP Terraform periodically runs a refresh-only plan and reports drift in the UI and through notifications. Caveats: assessments run on HCP Terraform's own schedule rather than one you set, so they may not meet a strict one-hour target; whether they are available depends on your HCP Terraform plan; and they only report, never remediate. Remediation is a normal run (revert with an apply, or accept by updating the configuration). For near-real-time alerts on critical resources, add cloud-native change detection such as AWS Config rules or Azure Activity Log alerts.

## Scenario 8: terraform test for a Module

**Question:** You maintain a public module and want CI to block PRs that break backward compatibility. How do you structure `terraform test` files?

**Answer:** Create `tests/` directory with three files:

- `tests/defaults.tftest.hcl`: `run "defaults" { command = plan; assert { condition = output.subnet_count == 2; error_message = "Default subnet count changed" } }`
- `tests/validation.tftest.hcl`: tests that invalid inputs trigger `validation` errors using `expect_failures`.
- `tests/integration.tftest.hcl`: `run "apply" { command = apply; ... }` with real provider (gated behind a CI secret for AWS creds).

Run via `terraform test` in CI. Unit tests (`command = plan`) are cheap and catch most regressions. Integration tests are slow but required for real provider behavior.

## Scenario 9: Run Triggers for Dependency Chains

**Question:** Workspace `network` manages the VPC. Workspace `apps` consumes the VPC ID via `terraform_remote_state`. When `network` changes CIDRs, `apps` must re-plan. How do you automate?

**Answer:** Configure a run trigger on `apps`: "Trigger runs when these source workspaces apply: [network]". Now, whenever `network` applies, `apps` automatically queues a plan. Read the VPC ID in `apps` with the `tfe_outputs` data source, which HashiCorp recommends over `terraform_remote_state` because it does not need access to the whole `network` state. `network` must expose the ID as a root-level output, and its remote state sharing setting must allow `apps` to read it.

## Scenario 10: Debugging a Provider Lock Conflict

**Question:** A teammate committed a `.terraform.lock.hcl` after upgrading the AWS provider. Your local CI runs on Linux AMD64 but produces a hash mismatch error. What is happening and how do you fix?

**Answer:** The lock file pins hashes for specific platforms. Your teammate likely locked on macOS ARM64 only. The fix: `terraform providers lock -platform=linux_amd64 -platform=darwin_arm64 -platform=darwin_amd64`. Commit the updated lock. This adds hashes for all platforms your team runs on without changing the selected version. Do not "fix" it with `terraform init -upgrade` in CI: that can select a different provider version than the one reviewed. Long-term fix: run `terraform providers lock` with all supported platforms whenever the lock file changes, and use `terraform init -lockfile=readonly` in CI.

## Scenario 11: Private Module Registry Versioning

**Question:** You publish a VPC module at v1.0.0. You add a breaking change. How do you release so consumers are not surprised?

**Answer:** Follow semver. A breaking change bumps major: v2.0.0. Tag the release in VCS (`git tag v2.0.0 && git push --tags`). The registry picks up the tag. Consumers pinning `version = "~> 1.0"` will not upgrade; those pinning `version = ">= 1.0"` will get the break on next init. Document the migration in a CHANGELOG.md. Optionally keep a `v1` maintenance branch for bug fixes without forcing upgrade.

## Scenario 12: Policy Set Scoping

**Question:** Your org has 3 projects: `security`, `platform`, `apps`. Security policies should apply to all projects. Cost policies only to `apps`. How do you configure Sentinel policy sets?

**Answer:** Create two policy sets: `global-security` attached at organization scope (applies to all workspaces in all projects), and `apps-cost` attached to the `apps` project only. HCP Terraform evaluates all applicable policy sets on each run. Workspaces in `apps` get both policies; workspaces in `platform` and `security` get only the global security set. Scope at the project level when possible to avoid per-workspace attachments, which are harder to maintain at scale.
