# ServiceNow Certified System Administrator (CSA)


## Overview

The **Certified System Administrator (CSA)** is the foundational ServiceNow credential. It validates the ability to configure, manage, and administer a ServiceNow instance: tables and the dictionary, list/form configuration, ACL-based security, business rules, client scripts, UI policies, Service Catalog, Knowledge, Flow Designer, reporting, and update set deployment.

CSA is a **prerequisite** for almost every other ServiceNow certification (CAD, all CIS-* implementation specialist certs, and the architect track). If you work on a ServiceNow instance professionally, this is the first cert you earn.

## Releases You Should Be Aware Of

ServiceNow ships two named releases per year. The CSA exam tracks the current Now Platform - questions reference UI Builder, Flow Designer, and the modern Next Experience UI, not legacy Workflow Editor or the pre-Madrid UI.

Recent / current releases (newest first):

- **Zurich** - latest current major
- **Yokohama**
- **Xanadu**
- **Washington DC**
- **Vancouver**
- (older: Utah, Tokyo, San Diego, Rome, Quebec, Paris)

Always confirm the release on your PDI matches what the cert blueprint references.

## Recommended Study Time

| Background | Estimated Prep Time |
|---|---|
| Active ServiceNow admin (1+ year hands-on) | 3-4 weeks |
| ITSM / ITIL background, no ServiceNow | 6-8 weeks |
| New to ServiceNow and to ITSM | 10-14 weeks (start with the Now Learning Fundamentals path) |

## Hands-on Setup

You **cannot** pass this cert without a live instance to click through. Most exam questions test specific UI navigation paths and configuration choices.

1. **Sign up for a [Personal Developer Instance (PDI)](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do)** - free, dedicated, on the latest release. Hibernates after ~10 days of inactivity but wakes on login.
2. **Complete the [Now Learning Fundamentals path](https://nowlearning.servicenow.com/lxp/en/now-platform/getting-started-with-servicenow)** - required for the cert voucher.
3. **Bookmark the [Now Create](https://nowlearning.servicenow.com/nowcreate) accelerators** for reference architecture patterns.
4. **Open the [Developer Documentation](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference)** - particularly the GlideRecord and GlideAjax API references.

## Companion Materials

- **ITIL 4 Foundation** _(not yet in this repo)_ - the IT service management framework ServiceNow's ITSM products implement. Conceptual companion to CSA. _(planned)_
- **[Salesforce Administrator](../../salesforce/administrator/)** - parallel "platform admin" cert on a different platform. Same shape: declarative config, role-based access, automation, reporting.
- **[AWS Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/)** - conceptual parallel for "self-service catalog" thinking. AWS Service Catalog provisions infrastructure; ServiceNow Service Catalog provisions any approved request type (HR, IT, facilities).

## After CSA

Common next steps:

- **Certified Application Developer (CAD)** - learn scoped applications, server-side scripting, UI components.
- **CIS-ITSM** - the most common follow-on; deepens Incident/Problem/Change/Request implementation.
- **CIS-Discovery** or **CIS-CMDB Health** - if you specialize in CMDB.
- **CIS-CSM** - Customer Service Management.
- **Now Assist / AI Agent Studio** - generative AI on the Now Platform (newer cert family).

The full CIS-* ladder requires CSA as a prerequisite. The architect track (CTA) is years out and gates on multi-instance, integration, and performance experience.
