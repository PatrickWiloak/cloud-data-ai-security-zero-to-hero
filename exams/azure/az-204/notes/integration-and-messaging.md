## Best Practices

### API Management
- Use products and subscriptions for API organization
- Implement rate limiting to protect backend services
- Use policies for request/response transformation
- Enable caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement proper versioning strategy
- Use named values for configuration management

### Event-driven Architecture
- Choose Event Grid for discrete events
- Use Event Hubs for high-volume streaming
- Implement idempotent event handlers
- Design events with clear schema and versioning
- Use dead letter queues for failed events
- Monitor event processing latency

### Message-based Communication
- Use Service Bus for enterprise messaging requirements
- Choose Queue Storage for simple, cost-effective queuing
- Implement message deduplication when necessary
- Set appropriate message TTL values
- Handle poison messages properly
- Use sessions for ordered message processing

## Common Scenarios

### API Management Patterns
- API gateway for microservices
- Legacy service modernization with facade pattern
- Rate limiting and throttling policies
- API monetization with subscription tiers
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) enablement

### Event Processing
- Real-time notification systems with Event Grid
- IoT telemetry processing with Event Hubs
- System integration through event subscriptions
- Event-driven automation workflows
- Reactive application architectures

### Message Processing
- Order processing workflows with Service Bus
- Asynchronous task processing with queues
- Fan-out messaging with topics and subscriptions
- Request-response patterns with reply queues
- Scheduled message processing
