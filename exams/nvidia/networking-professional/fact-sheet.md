- RoCE support for RDMA over Ethernet
- Priority Flow Control (PFC) for lossless Ethernet
- ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)
- Large MTU support (jumbo frames)
- ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Path) for load balancing

## Domain 3: RDMA and RoCE

### RDMA Fundamentals

**Benefits:**
- Zero-copy data transfer (no CPU involvement)
- Kernel bypass (user-space to NIC directly)
- Low latency (microseconds)
- High throughput (near wire speed)
- Low CPU overhead

**RDMA Operations:**
- **Send/Receive** - Two-sided operations
- **RDMA Write** - One-sided remote memory write
- **RDMA Read** - One-sided remote memory read
- **Atomic** - Remote atomic operations (compare-and-swap)

### RoCE Versions

**RoCE v1:**
- RDMA over Ethernet Layer 2
- Uses Ethertype for RDMA packets
- Limited to single broadcast domain (same VLAN)
- No IP routing support

**RoCE v2:**
- RDMA over UDP/IP
- Routable across subnets
- Standard choice for modern deployments
- Requires lossless Ethernet (PFC or similar)

### Lossless Ethernet Configuration

**Priority Flow Control (PFC):**
- Per-priority pause mechanism
- Prevents packet loss for RDMA traffic
- Configured on specific traffic classes
- Must be consistent across all switches in path
- Risk of deadlock if misconfigured

**Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN):**
- End-to-end congestion notification
- Switches mark packets when queue exceeds threshold
- Receivers echo congestion to senders
- Senders reduce rate in response
- Preferred over PFC for congestion management

**DCQCN (Data Center QoS for Converged Networks):**
- Combines PFC and ECN
- Rate-based congestion control for RoCE
- Widely used in AI data centers
- Implemented in ConnectX adapters

### GPUDirect RDMA
- Direct data path between GPU memory and network adapter
- Bypasses CPU and system memory
- Requires GPU and NIC on same PCIe root complex (or NVSwitch)
- Essential for efficient multi-node GPU communication
- Used by NCCL for distributed training

## Domain 4: Network Topologies for AI

### Fat-Tree
- Standard leaf-spine architecture
- Full bisection bandwidth (non-blocking)
- Predictable latency
- Scales to hundreds of nodes
- Higher switch count at scale

### Rail-Optimized
- Each GPU NIC connects to a dedicated rail switch
- Corresponding ranks across nodes share a rail
- Optimized for all-reduce communication pattern
- Fewer switches than full fat-tree
- Used in DGX SuperPOD reference architecture

### Dragonfly
- Groups connected by global links
- Low diameter (few hops between any two nodes)
- Efficient for very large clusters
- More complex routing algorithms
- Lower cost at extreme scale

### Adaptive Routing
- Dynamically select paths based on congestion
- Avoids hot spots in the fabric
- Supported by InfiniBand and Spectrum switches
- Improves effective bisection bandwidth
- Critical for large-scale AI workloads

- Latency histogram collection
- Congestion detection
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Historical trend reporting

**UFM Health Monitoring:**
