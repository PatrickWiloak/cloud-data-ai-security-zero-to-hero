# Multi-Agent Systems

**[📖 NVIDIA Multi-Agent Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/tag/build-ai-agent/)** - NVIDIA resources on multi-agent architectures

## Multi-Agent Architecture Fundamentals

### Why Multi-Agent?

- **Specialization** - Each agent focuses on a specific domain or skill
- **Scalability** - Add agents for new capabilities without modifying existing ones
- **Robustness** - Failure of one agent does not necessarily halt the system
- **Complexity management** - Break complex tasks into manageable agent responsibilities
- **Parallel processing** - Independent agents can work simultaneously

### Agent Roles

**Common Role Patterns:**
- **Orchestrator** - Coordinates other agents, manages task flow
- **Researcher** - Gathers and synthesizes information
- **Coder** - Writes, reviews, and debugs code
- **Critic** - Evaluates outputs and provides feedback
- **Planner** - Decomposes tasks and creates execution plans
- **Executor** - Carries out specific actions using tools
- **Validator** - Checks results against requirements and constraints

## Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Orchestration
- Agents execute in a defined order
- Output of one agent feeds as input to the next
- Simple to reason about and debug
- Slowest execution - no parallelism
- Best for pipeline-style workflows

### Parallel Orchestration
- Independent agents run simultaneously
- Results are aggregated at a synchronization point
- Faster execution for independent sub-tasks
- Requires careful result merging
- Best when tasks can be cleanly decomposed

### Hierarchical Orchestration
- Top-level orchestrator delegates to sub-orchestrators
- Each sub-orchestrator manages a team of specialized agents
- Scales to complex organizational structures
- Clear chain of responsibility
- Best for large, multi-domain tasks

### Dynamic Orchestration
- Orchestrator decides which agents to invoke at runtime
- Agent selection based on task analysis and available capabilities
- Agents can spawn or invoke other agents as needed
- Most flexible but hardest to predict and debug
- Best for open-ended tasks with variable requirements

## Communication Patterns

### Message Passing
- Agents communicate through structured messages
- Messages include role, content, and metadata
- Supports request-response and publish-subscribe patterns
- Message queues for asynchronous communication
- Serializable for persistence and replay

### Shared Blackboard
- Central data store that all agents can read and write
- Agents monitor the blackboard for relevant updates
- Reduces direct agent-to-agent coupling
- Requires access control and conflict resolution
- Good for collaborative problem-solving

### Event-Driven
- Agents emit events when they complete work or detect conditions
- Other agents subscribe to relevant event types
- Loose coupling between agents
- Supports reactive and proactive agent behaviors
- Scalable to many agents

## Conflict Resolution

### Voting
- Multiple agents vote on the best answer or action
- Majority vote or weighted voting based on agent expertise
- Simple to implement, democratic decision-making

### Debate
- Agents present arguments for their position
- Iterative refinement through structured discussion
- Converge on consensus or escalate to a judge agent
- Improves quality through adversarial review

### Authority-Based
- Designated authority agent makes final decisions
- Other agents provide recommendations and evidence
- Clear accountability and predictable outcomes
- Risk of single point of failure

### Escalation
- Start with automated resolution
- Escalate to senior agent or human when confidence is low
- Tiered approach balances automation and oversight

## Shared Memory and Knowledge

### Shared Context
- Common knowledge base accessible to all agents
- Updated as agents discover new information
- Versioned to track knowledge evolution
- Access-controlled for sensitive information

### Task State
- Shared tracking of task progress and status
- Each agent updates its portion of the task state
- Orchestrator monitors overall progress
- Enables checkpoint and resume for long tasks

### Collaboration Protocols
- **Handoff** - One agent explicitly transfers control to another
- **Delegation** - Agent assigns sub-tasks to other agents
- **Consultation** - Agent requests input from another without transferring control
- **Notification** - Agent informs others of important events or results

## Design Considerations

### Agent Granularity
- Too few agents - each agent too complex, hard to maintain
- Too many agents - excessive communication overhead
- Balance specialization depth with coordination costs
- Start simple, add agents as complexity demands

### Failure Handling
- Individual agent failure should not crash the system
- Retry failed agent tasks with same or alternative agent
- Timeout enforcement for each agent interaction
- Graceful degradation when agents are unavailable
- Dead letter handling for unprocessable messages

### Performance
- Minimize inter-agent communication for latency-sensitive tasks
- Cache frequently accessed shared state
- Batch messages when possible
- Monitor agent utilization and adjust scaling

### Testing Multi-Agent Systems
- Unit test each agent in isolation
- Integration test agent pairs and communication
- End-to-end test complete workflows
- Chaos testing - randomly disable agents
- Load testing - verify scaling under concurrent tasks

## Key Exam Concepts

- Know orchestration patterns: sequential, parallel, hierarchical, dynamic
- Understand communication methods: message passing, blackboard, events
- Agent role design and specialization principles
- Conflict resolution strategies: voting, debate, authority
- Shared memory and knowledge management
- Failure handling in multi-agent systems
