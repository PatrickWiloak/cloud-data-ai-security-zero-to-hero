## Bias in Large Language Models

### Sources of Bias

**Training Data Bias:**
- Web-scraped data reflects existing societal biases
- Overrepresentation of certain demographics, languages, and viewpoints
- Historical biases encoded in text (gender roles, stereotypes)
- Geographic and cultural bias toward English-speaking Western content
- Temporal bias toward recent content in training data

**Annotation Bias:**
- Human labelers bring their own biases to data annotation
- Inconsistent labeling standards across annotator groups
- Cultural context influences what is considered "correct" or "preferred"
- Majority viewpoints can dominate preference data

**Algorithmic Amplification:**
- Models can amplify biases present in training data
- Frequent co-occurrences in data become stronger associations
- Autoregressive generation can reinforce stereotypical patterns
- Larger models can exhibit more nuanced but still biased behavior

### Types of Bias in LLM Outputs

- **Stereotyping** - associating groups with fixed characteristics
- **Representation bias** - over/under-representing certain groups
- **Toxicity** - generating harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content
- **Sentiment bias** - different sentiment when discussing different groups
- **Allocation bias** - different quality of service for different users

### Bias Detection

**Benchmark Evaluations:**
- BBQ (Bias Benchmark for QA) - measures social biases in question answering
- WinoBias - evaluates gender bias in coreference resolution
- ToxiGen - measures toxic language generation toward minority groups
- BOLD (Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation) - domain-specific bias

**Manual Evaluation:**
- Red-teaming with diverse evaluators
- Demographic-specific test prompts
- Comparative analysis across different user groups
- Domain expert review for specialized applications

### Bias Mitigation

**Pre-training:**
- Curate diverse and balanced training data
- Filter or downsample biased content
- Include explicit debiasing data
- Multi-language and multi-cultural data sources

**Fine-tuning:**
- RLHF/DPO with debiasing preference data
- Instruction tuning with balanced examples
- Constitutional AI approaches (principles-based training)

**Inference:**
- Output filtering and content moderation
- NeMo Guardrails for real-time bias detection
- Post-processing to identify and flag biased responses
- Human review for high-stakes applications

### What are Guardrails?

Guardrails are programmable rules and mechanisms that control the input and output behavior of LLM applications. They act as safety layers between users and the LLM.

### Types of Rails

**Input Rails:**
- Process and filter user inputs before they reach the LLM
- Detect prompt injection attempts
- Block harmful or off-topic queries
- Validate input format and content

**Output Rails:**
- Process and filter LLM responses before returning to the user
- Block harmful, toxic, or inappropriate content
- Ensure response stays within allowed topics
- Verify factual accuracy against knowledge bases

**Topical Rails:**
- Restrict conversation to allowed topics and domains
- Redirect off-topic queries with appropriate messages
- Define topic boundaries using Colang definitions
- Example: Insurance chatbot stays on insurance topics

**Safety Rails:**
- Block generation of harmful or dangerous content
- Detect and prevent hate speech, harassment, threats
- Filter personally identifiable information (PII)
- Enforce content policies

**Fact-Checking Rails:**
- Verify claims against knowledge bases
- Cross-reference generated statements with trusted sources
- Flag uncertain or unverifiable claims
- Integrate with RAG for source validation

### Colang Language

NeMo Guardrails uses Colang, a modeling language for conversational flows:

```colang
define user ask about medical advice
  "Can you diagnose my condition?"
  "What medication should I take?"
  "Am I sick?"

define bot refuse medical advice
  "I'm not qualified to provide medical advice. Please consult a healthcare professional."

define flow medical advice
  user ask about medical advice
  bot refuse medical advice
```

### Implementation Architecture

1. **User Input** -> Input Rails (filter/validate)
2. Input Rails -> **LLM Processing** (generate response)
3. LLM Response -> Output Rails (filter/validate)
4. Output Rails -> **User Response** (safe, validated)

## Hallucination

### Types of Hallucination

**Factual Hallucination:**
- Generating statements that are factually incorrect
- Example: "The Eiffel Tower was built in 1920" (actually 1889)
- Most dangerous for knowledge-intensive applications

**Faithfulness Hallucination:**
- Generating content that contradicts the provided context
- Common in RAG systems when model ignores retrieved documents
- Example: Context says "revenue was $5M" but model says "$10M"

**Fabrication:**
- Creating non-existent references, citations, or entities
- Example: Citing a paper that does not exist
- Particularly problematic for academic and legal applications

### Causes of Hallucination

- Training data contains incorrect information
- Model generalizes patterns beyond their validity
- Lack of grounding in specific, verified sources
- Autoregressive generation can compound errors
- Model optimized for fluency over factual accuracy

### Mitigation Strategies

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**
- Ground responses in retrieved, verified documents
- Most effective single approach for reducing factual hallucination
- Instruct model to only answer based on provided context

**Temperature Control:**
- Lower temperature reduces creative but inaccurate outputs
- Temperature=0 for factual tasks minimizes hallucination
- Higher temperature increases hallucination risk

**Source Attribution:**
- Require model to cite sources for claims
- Enables verification of generated statements
- Include source URLs or document references

**Confidence Scoring:**
- Assess model uncertainty in generated responses
- Flag low-confidence outputs for human review
- Abstain from answering when confidence is too low

**Human-in-the-Loop:**
- Critical applications require human verification
- Automated flagging of uncertain or high-risk outputs
- Regular audit of model outputs for accuracy

**NeMo Guardrails:**
- Fact-checking rails verify claims against knowledge bases
- Output validation catches known hallucination patterns
- Programmable rules for domain-specific verification

## Privacy and Data Governance

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

**Detection:**
- Identify PII in user inputs (names, addresses, SSN, email, phone)
- Scan model outputs for PII leakage
- Use NER models or regex patterns for PII detection

**Protection:**
- Redact or mask PII before processing
- Prevent model from memorizing PII from training data
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Anonymize data used for model improvement

### Data Governance

**Training Data:**
- Document data sources and licensing
- Ensure compliance with data usage agreements
- Handle copyright and intellectual property considerations
- Track data provenance and lineage

**User Data:**
- Clear consent mechanisms for data collection
- Data minimization - collect only what is needed
- Right to deletion - support data removal requests
- Audit logging for data access and usage

### Regulatory Considerations

**[📖 EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)** - European AI regulation
**[📖 NIST AI RMF](https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/executive-order-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence)** - US AI risk framework

**EU AI Act (Awareness Level):**
- Risk-based categorization of AI systems
- High-risk systems require transparency, documentation, human oversight
- General-purpose AI models have specific obligations
- Prohibited AI practices (e.g., social scoring)

**General Principles:**
- Transparency - users should know they are interacting with AI
- Accountability - clear responsibility for AI system behavior
- Fairness - AI should not discriminate
- Safety - AI should not cause harm
- Privacy - protect user data and prevent unauthorized access

## Red-Teaming and Adversarial Testing

### What is Red-Teaming?

Systematic testing of AI systems by adversarial evaluators who attempt to find failures, biases, and safety vulnerabilities.

### Red-Teaming Approaches

**Manual Red-Teaming:**
- Human evaluators craft adversarial prompts
- Test for bias, toxicity, harmful content generation
- Attempt to bypass safety measures
- Evaluate edge cases and unexpected inputs

**Automated Red-Teaming:**
- Use LLMs to generate adversarial test cases
- Scale testing across many scenarios
- Systematic coverage of known vulnerability categories
- Continuous testing during development

### Categories to Test

- **Harmful content** - violence, self-harm, illegal activities
- **Bias and discrimination** - stereotypes, unfair treatment
- **Privacy violations** - PII extraction, personal information disclosure
- **Misinformation** - factually incorrect claims, conspiracy theories
- **Jailbreaking** - bypassing system prompts and safety measures
- **Prompt injection** - overriding model instructions
- **Copyright** - reproducing copyrighted material
