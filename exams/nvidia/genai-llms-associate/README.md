## Exam Tips

### Question Strategy
1. **Read carefully** - identify whether the question asks about architecture, deployment, or best practices
2. **Look for keywords:**
   - "Most efficient" - quantization, batching optimization, PEFT
   - "Best quality" - full fine-tuning, larger context, careful prompt design
   - "Production ready" - NIM, Triton, monitoring, guardrails
   - "Cost effective" - LoRA/QLoRA, quantization, smaller models
   - "Safe and responsible" - NeMo Guardrails, content filtering, bias testing
3. **NVIDIA preference** - when multiple valid approaches exist, prefer NVIDIA ecosystem tools
4. **Eliminate wrong answers** - remove options that mix up concepts or use wrong terminology

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing encoder-only (BERT) with decoder-only (GPT) model capabilities
- Mixing up LoRA and full fine-tuning resource requirements
- Not understanding the difference between NIM and TensorRT-LLM
- Confusing vector database indexing methods
- Overlooking the importance of chunking strategy in RAG
- Misunderstanding quantization precision trade-offs

### Time Management
- 60 minutes for 50-60 questions = approximately 1 minute per question
- Flag uncertain questions and return later
- Don't spend more than 90 seconds on any question initially
- Leave 10 minutes for review of flagged questions
