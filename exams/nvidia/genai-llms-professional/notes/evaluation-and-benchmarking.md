## Key Topics

### 1. Language Model Benchmarks

**General Knowledge and Reasoning**

- **HellaSwag:** Commonsense reasoning completion tasks
- **ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge):** Science question answering
- **Winogrande:** Commonsense reasoning with pronoun resolution
- **TruthfulQA:** Evaluates tendency to generate truthful answers

**Code Generation**
- **HumanEval:** 164 Python programming problems, Pass@k metric
- **MBPP:** 974 Python programming problems
- **CodeContests:** Competitive programming problems
- **DS-1000:** Data science coding tasks

**Math and Reasoning**

- **BBH (Big Bench Hard):** Challenging reasoning tasks

**Conversation and Instruction Following**

### 2. Evaluation Metrics

**Language Modeling Metrics**
- **Perplexity:** Exponential of cross-entropy loss. Lower is better.
- **Cross-entropy loss:** Standard training loss metric
- Perplexity measures language modeling quality, not task quality
- Useful for comparing model quality during pre-training

**Generation Quality Metrics**
- **BLEU:** N-gram overlap with reference text
- **ROUGE:** Recall-oriented text overlap metrics
- **BERTScore:** Semantic similarity using contextual embeddings
- **Pass@k (Code):** Probability of correct solution in k attempts

**Classification Metrics**
- **Accuracy:** Fraction of correct predictions
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC:** Area under receiver operating characteristic curve

**Human Evaluation**
- Likert scale ratings for quality, helpfulness, safety
- Pairwise preference comparisons (A vs B)
- Inter-annotator agreement metrics
- Gold standard for final quality assessment

### 3. LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

**Approach**
- Use a strong LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to evaluate outputs of another model
- Score on multiple dimensions: helpfulness, accuracy, safety
- More scalable than human evaluation
- Correlates well with human judgments for many tasks

**Best Practices**
- Use detailed evaluation rubrics in the judge prompt
- Include reference answers when available
- Average scores across multiple evaluations
- Validate judge accuracy against human annotations
- Be aware of position bias (order of presented options)

**Limitations**
- Self-preference bias (models may prefer their own outputs)
- Limited for specialized domain evaluation
- Cannot fully replace human evaluation for safety
- Judge quality depends on judge model capability

### 4. RAG-Specific Evaluation

**Retrieval Quality**
- **Precision@k:** Relevant documents in top-k / k
- **Recall@k:** Relevant documents found / total relevant
- **MRR:** Mean Reciprocal Rank of first relevant result
- **NDCG:** Considers both relevance and ranking position
- **Hit Rate:** Queries with at least one relevant result

**Generation Quality for RAG**
- **Faithfulness:** Answer consistent with retrieved context
- **Answer Relevancy:** Answer addresses the user question
- **Context Relevancy:** Retrieved context is relevant to query
- **Groundedness:** Claims in answer are supported by context

**RAGAS Framework**
- Automated RAG evaluation combining multiple metrics
- Measures faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision/recall
- Works without ground-truth answers for some metrics
- Uses LLM-as-judge for quality assessment

### 5. Performance Benchmarking

**Key Performance Metrics**
- **Time-to-First-Token (TTFT):** Latency from request to first generated token
- **Inter-Token Latency (ITL):** Time between consecutive generated tokens
- **Tokens per Second (TPS):** Generation throughput
- **Requests per Second (RPS):** Serving throughput
- **GPU Utilization:** Percentage of GPU compute used
- **GPU Memory Usage:** VRAM consumption during inference

**Benchmarking Methodology**
- Use representative workloads (realistic input/output lengths)
- Test at various concurrency levels (1, 10, 50, 100+ users)
- Measure both throughput and latency distributions (p50, p95, p99)
- Compare against baseline configuration
- Run multiple iterations for statistical significance

**NVIDIA Benchmarking Tools**
- TensorRT-LLM benchmarking scripts
- NVIDIA Model Analyzer for Triton deployments
- GPU profiling with NVIDIA Nsight Systems
- DCGM for GPU-level metrics collection

### 6. Model Comparison Framework

**Controlled Comparison**
- Same evaluation data and prompts across models
- Same hardware and inference configuration
- Same generation parameters (temperature, top-p, max tokens)
- Report confidence intervals and statistical significance

**Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
- Quality (benchmark scores, human evaluation)
- Latency (TTFT, ITL at target concurrency)
- Throughput (TPS, RPS at target quality)
- Cost (GPU hours, cost per 1M tokens)
- Memory (VRAM requirements, scaling characteristics)

**Decision Framework**
- Define requirements: quality threshold, latency SLA, budget
- Rank candidates on each dimension
- Identify Pareto-optimal configurations
- Validate winner on production-representative workloads

### 7. Safety and Alignment Evaluation

**Safety Benchmarks**
- Toxicity detection accuracy
- Bias evaluation across demographic groups
- Jailbreak resistance testing
- PII leakage assessment

**Alignment Metrics**
- Instruction following accuracy
- Refusal appropriateness (not over-refusing, not under-refusing)
- Helpfulness rating
- Honesty (admitting uncertainty, avoiding fabrication)

**Red-Teaming**
- Adversarial prompt testing
- Multi-turn attack scenarios
- Automated red-teaming with adversarial models
- Document and mitigate discovered vulnerabilities
