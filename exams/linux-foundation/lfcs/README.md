# Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)

## Exam Overview

The LFCS certification validates the skills needed to perform system administration tasks on Linux systems. This is a **performance-based exam** conducted entirely in a live terminal environment - you must demonstrate actual command-line skills, not just answer multiple choice questions.

**Exam Details:**
- **Exam Code:** LFCS
- **Duration:** 2 hours (120 minutes)
- **Format:** Performance-based (hands-on terminal tasks)
- **Passing Score:** 66%
- **Cost:** $395 USD (includes one free retake)
- **Proctoring:** PSI online proctoring
- **Validity:** 3 years
- **Prerequisites:** None required (basic Linux experience recommended)
- **Distributions:** Ubuntu 22.04 (default exam environment)

## CRITICAL: This is a Hands-On Exam

Unlike multiple-choice exams, LFCS requires you to perform actual tasks in a live Linux terminal. You will NOT be selecting answers from a list. You must:

- Execute commands correctly from memory
- Configure services and verify they work
- Troubleshoot real system issues
- Navigate the filesystem efficiently
- Use man pages and built-in help effectively

**The #1 study strategy is practice, practice, practice on real Linux systems.**

## Practice Environment

### Setting Up a Practice Lab

**Option 1: Virtual Machine (Recommended)**
- Install VirtualBox or VMware
- Create Ubuntu 22.04 VM
- Practice all commands and configurations
- Take snapshots for easy reset

**Option 2: Cloud Instance**
- Launch EC2 (AWS Free Tier) or GCE instance
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Practice SSH, networking, services

**Option 3: WSL2 (Windows)**
