# Claude Prompt Engineering Specialist - Self-Directed Study Track

> ℹ️ **Study track, not an official certification.** Anthropic runs four official Claude certifications ([Associate](../claude-certified-associate-foundations/), [Developer](../claude-certified-developer-foundations/), [Architect Foundations](../claude-certified-architect-foundations/), [Architect Professional](../claude-certified-architect-professional/)), but none of them is a dedicated prompt engineering exam. This remains a self-directed proficiency track for engineers focused on the craft of prompt design, and it doubles as depth work for the prompting domains on all four official exams.

## Track Overview

This track covers the ability to design, evaluate, and iterate prompts that produce reliable, high-quality outputs from Claude models. Where the Architect certifications focus on system design and the Developer certification on API mechanics, this Specialist track focuses on the craft of the prompt itself: clarity, structure, examples, reasoning elicitation, evaluation, and prompt-engineering patterns at production scale.

Material is grounded in Anthropic's published prompt engineering guide and related cookbook recipes.

This track targets prompt engineers, AI engineers, applied scientists, technical writers crossing into AI, and product engineers responsible for the quality of LLM outputs.

## Skill Area Summaries

### 1 - Prompt Fundamentals and Anatomy

The structure of an effective Claude prompt: system, user, optional examples, optional context, optional reasoning instructions. The role of clarity, specificity, and ordering. Why Claude responds well to certain stylistic choices.

### 2 - System Prompts and Role Prompting

Setting the model's persona, constraints, capabilities, and default behaviors via the `system` field. When role prompting helps and when it backfires. Composing system prompts for multi-feature assistants.

### 3 - Chain-of-Thought and Extended Thinking

Eliciting step-by-step reasoning. The difference between explicit chain-of-thought instructions in the prompt and Claude's native extended thinking. When to use each.

### 4 - XML Tags and Structured Outputs

Why Claude responds especially well to XML-tagged sections. Common tag patterns (instructions, context, examples, output_format). Combining XML tags with forced tool choice for structured extraction.

### 5 - Few-Shot and Example-Driven Prompting

How many examples to include. How to choose representative examples. Many-shot prompting. Counter-examples. Example ordering effects.

### 6 - Prompt Evaluation and Iteration

Writing eval datasets. LLM-as-judge for prompt quality. A/B testing prompt variants. Regression gates for prompt changes. Calibrating judges.

### 7 - Prompt Caching Design Patterns

Designing prompts so the static prefix is large enough to cache. Avoiding accidental cache invalidation. Layering cache breakpoints.

## Study Approach

1. Read Anthropic's prompt engineering guide cover to cover, twice.
2. Build a prompt eval harness for one real task and use it.
3. Maintain a prompt journal: every change, the hypothesis, the result.
4. Use real model IDs: `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5`.

The fastest way to internalize this material is to ship one prompt-driven feature with measured quality improvements.
