## 🎓 Not chasing a certification?

The **[Learn](./learn/)** pillar is for everyone who wants to understand cloud and AI without an exam date:

- **[Day One](./learn/day-one/)** - terminal, git, HTTP, servers. Strict beginner on-ramp.
- **[Concepts](./learn/concepts/)** - 22+ bite-size pages (5-10 min each) on cloud + AI primitives.
- **[Cloud from Scratch](./learn/cloud-from-scratch.md)** + **[AI from Scratch](./learn/ai-from-scratch.md)** - structured 8-phase paths.
- **[Glossary](./learn/glossary.md)** - 200+ terms in plain English.
- **[YouTube curation](./learn/youtube.md)** - filtered videos worth your time.

Come back when you decide to certify. Many do, after using the Learn pillar to figure out which direction.
