# TODO

Working task list for **cloud-data-ai-security-zero-to-hero**. Read this at the start of a work session and keep it current as work completes - check items off with a date, add follow-ups as they surface. Stale TODOs are worse than none. Security debt (if any) is tracked separately in `SECURITY-DEBT.md`.

## Open

Backlog derived from the repo-wide gap analysis in
[docs/improvement-roadmap.md](./docs/improvement-roadmap.md) (2026-07-28). See that
document for evidence, counts, and reasoning behind each item.

Add items as `- [ ] task`, grouped by priority or theme. Mark done inline:
`- [x] ~~task~~ ✅ done YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Priority 1 - correctness

- [x] ~~Fix `build-freshness-ledger.sh` path bug, then regenerate `docs/freshness.md`~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 (cleared 191 broken links)
- [x] ~~Rewrite 87 absolute `/exams/...` links as relative~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29
- [x] ~~Repoint or remove 28 links to the old directory layout~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29
- [x] ~~Update `STUDY-HUB.md` provider table~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 (added ISACA, Offensive Security, Palo Alto, ServiceNow, VMware; corrected AWS 18, CompTIA 4, Cisco 2, Salesforce 3)
- [x] ~~Update cert/provider badge counts~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 (133 certs / 26 providers, not 127/27 - see note below)
- [x] ~~Split `link-check.yml` into a blocking internal-link job and an advisory external-URL job~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29
- [x] ~~Fix cert discovery in `validate-cert-structure.sh` and `build-freshness-ledger.sh`~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29

> **Count correction.** The gap analysis first reported 127 certs because both scripts
> discovered cert dirs by looking for a `notes/` subdir, which skipped the 10 certs whose
> notes were never drafted. Counting by `fact-sheet.md` gives 137 cert dirs: 133
> certifications across 26 providers, plus 4 Anthropic study tracks. Both scripts now use
> `fact-sheet.md`, so the validator checks all 137 instead of 127.

### Priority 2 - content substance

- [x] ~~Write notes for the 10 outline-stage certs~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29. All now active with drafted notes, links restored, banners removed. No cert is at outline stage.
  - [x] ~~comptia/cysa-plus~~ (4 notes)
  - [x] ~~comptia/network-plus~~ (5 notes)
  - [x] ~~cisco/ccnp-enterprise-encor-350-401~~ (6 notes)
  - [x] ~~isaca/cisa~~ (5 notes)
  - [x] ~~isaca/cism~~ (4 notes)
  - [x] ~~offensive-security/oscp-pen-200~~ (6 notes)
  - [x] ~~palo-alto-networks/pcnsa~~ (4 notes + scenarios + strategy)
  - [x] ~~salesforce/platform-developer-2~~ (6 notes + strategy)
  - [x] ~~servicenow/csa~~ (6 notes + scenarios + strategy)
  - [x] ~~vmware/vcp-dcv-2v0-21-23~~ (6 notes)
- [x] ~~Resolve the diagram standard~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 - Mermaid is now the documented default, PNG the exception. Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `assets/diagrams/README.md`.
- [x] ~~Add index READMEs to the 21 provider directories that lack one~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 (all 27 now generated from `docs/certs.json`; the 6 hand-written ones kept their editorial content)
- [x] ~~Complete `aws/professional/genai-developer-aip-c01`~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 - practice-plan, scenarios, strategy written. Structure validator is at zero warnings.
- [x] ~~Move `exams/aws/genai` under `foundational/`; reconcile `azure/genai` and `gcp/genai` placement~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 (AI Practitioner moved to `exams/aws/foundational/ai-practitioner-aif-c01/`; the Azure and GCP dirs are study tracks, kept in place and now counted as `track` rather than certification)
- [x] ~~Replace the 2 remaining `last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD` placeholders~~ ✅ 2026-07-29 - not applicable. Both live inside ```yaml fenced blocks in `CLAUDE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` that document the frontmatter convention. The original scan did not skip code fences. No stale frontmatter exists.

### Priority 3 - leverage

- [x] ~~Build `docs/certs.json` from fact-sheets; generate the hub table and provider indexes from it~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 (CI fails if either is stale). Freshness ledger still generates independently - fold it in if it drifts.
- [ ] Add practice questions for uncovered certs. 34 of 137 covered; 103 have none. Use [the template](./resources/practice-questions/template.md). Highest value first: the certs that already have complete notes but no question bank.
- [ ] Add Tier 1 certifications: SC-100, SC-300, SC-400, PL-300, CNCF associates (OTCA/CGOA/CAPA/CCA/CNPA), Oracle OCI GenAI, Google GenAI Leader, ISC2 CC, an observability cert.
- [x] ~~Stagger `last-updated` re-verification by provider batch~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 - `check-cert-freshness.py` assigns each provider a review month and reports what is due. The rotation exists; the re-verification work itself is ongoing (12 certs due in month 7).

### Priority 4 - differentiation

- [x] ~~Per-cert `flashcards.csv` (Anki-importable)~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 - 80 decks, 6,487 cards. 57 certs fall below the 15-card threshold and get no deck; raising that means writing more `- **Term** - definition` lines in their notes.
- [x] ~~Map labs to the certs they support~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 - 15 labs mapped to 46 certs, generated both directions. 91 certs still have no lab.
- [x] ~~Add `status:` and `exam-version:` frontmatter plus a revision-warning script~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 - `status` is derived in `certs.json` rather than hand-declared (no drift). `exam-version:`/`exam-retires:` are optional frontmatter, seeded on the 4 retired AWS certs; `check-cert-freshness.py` warns ahead of a known retirement.
- [x] ~~Wire `check-orphan-links.sh` into CI~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29 - runs advisory (never blocking, since orphan detection is heuristic). Orphans are currently 0.
- [x] ~~Prune `.claude/settings.json`~~ ✅ done 2026-07-29
