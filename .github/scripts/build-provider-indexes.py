"""Generate navigation from docs/certs.json.

Three outputs, all derived from the cert index so their counts cannot drift:

  1. exams/<provider>/README.md - a per-provider index table. Six providers already
     have hand-written READMEs with real editorial content (provider history, full
     vendor catalogs including certs this repo does not cover). Those are preserved:
     only the block between the generated markers is replaced.

  2. The provider table in STUDY-HUB.md, between the same markers.

  3. The "Browse Certifications" table in README.md, likewise.

Counts, codes, levels, and statuses come from the index. The one-line "Highlights"
blurb per provider is editorial and stays curated below - one string, used by both
tables, so the two cannot describe the same provider differently.

The README table was hand-written until 2026-08-14, and by then had gone stale in
8 of 22 rows with 5 providers missing entirely: Kubernetes/CNCF read 7 against 12
and Azure 23 against 26, five days after the Tier 1 batch landed. Generating it is
what stops that recurring. `main()` also refuses to run if a provider has no
curated highlight or emoji, so a new provider fails CI rather than appearing as a
blank row.

Run:    python3 .github/scripts/build-provider-indexes.py
        python3 .github/scripts/build-provider-indexes.py --check   # CI: fail if stale
