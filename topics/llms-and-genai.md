# LLMs and GenAI

Everything in the repo on language models, retrieval, agents, fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, and the surrounding tooling. Start here whether you're trying to understand transformers, ship a RAG system, pick a vector database, or pass an AI cert.

## Learn

Plain-English concept pages, 5-10 minute reads:

**Foundations**
- [LLM basics](../learn/concepts/llm-basics.md) - what an LLM actually is, tokens, context, why it can't count
- [Transformer architecture](../learn/concepts/transformer-architecture.md) - attention, self-attention, what's inside the box
- [Embeddings and vector search](../learn/concepts/embeddings-and-vector-search.md) - dense representations, similarity
- [Context windows and management](../learn/concepts/context-windows-and-management.md) - tokenization, limits, summarization, retrieval as extension
- [Multimodal models](../learn/concepts/multimodal-models.md) - vision, audio, video inputs

**Building with LLMs**
- [Prompt engineering](../learn/concepts/prompt-engineering.md) - the patterns that work, the ones that don't
- [Tool use and function calling](../learn/concepts/tool-use-and-function-calling.md) - giving an LLM hands
- [MCP explained](../learn/concepts/mcp-explained.md) - Model Context Protocol, the standard interface for tools
- [Structured outputs](../learn/concepts/structured-outputs.md) - JSON mode, schemas, constrained decoding
- [RAG explained](../learn/concepts/rag-explained.md) - retrieval-augmented generation, the workhorse pattern
- [Fine-tuning vs RAG](../learn/concepts/fine-tuning-vs-rag.md) - when to use which (mostly RAG)
- [Agents explained](../learn/concepts/agents-explained.md) - tool-using LLMs in a loop
- [Agentic loops](../learn/concepts/agentic-loops.md) - ReAct, planner/executor splits, harnesses, failure modes
- [Prompt caching](../learn/concepts/prompt-caching.md) - cache hits, when caching pays off

**Operations**
- [Evals for LLMs](../learn/concepts/evals-for-llms.md) - how to know if changes helped or hurt
- [Guardrails and safety](../learn/concepts/guardrails-and-safety.md) - input/output filtering, content moderation
- [Inference servers](../learn/concepts/inference-servers.md) - vLLM, TGI, SGLang, llama.cpp
- [Quantization and distillation](../learn/concepts/quantization-and-distillation.md) - smaller models, less memory
