# SRE and reliability

Site reliability engineering, observability, chaos engineering, and disaster recovery - everything in the repo about keeping systems up and knowing when they're not. SRE overlaps with [observability](./observability.md) but pulls in DR patterns, chaos engineering, multi-region design, and the certs that test those.

## Learn

- [Observability basics](../learn/concepts/observability-basics.md) - logs, metrics, traces, the three pillars
- [Eventual consistency](https://data.noblerworks.com/learn/concepts/eventual-consistency/) - reliability under partial failure
- [Idempotency explained](../learn/concepts/idempotency-explained.md) - retry-safe operations are the foundation of resilience
- [Regions and availability zones](../learn/concepts/regions-and-availability-zones.md) - the geography of resilience
