# FinOps

FinOps - the practice of bringing financial accountability to cloud spend. Covers the FinOps Foundation cert family, per-cloud cost-optimization deep-dives, the well-architected cost pillars, and the architectural patterns that compound to lower bills.

## Learn

- [What is cloud computing?](../learn/concepts/what-is-cloud-computing.md) - capex → opex is the FinOps premise
- [Serverless explained](../learn/concepts/serverless-explained.md) - pay-per-use lever
- [Regions and availability zones](../learn/concepts/regions-and-availability-zones.md) - region pricing matters
- [Multi-account strategy and landing zones](../learn/concepts/multi-account-and-landing-zones.md) - per-account billing and budgets make cost ownership real
- [Well-Architected explained](../learn/concepts/well-architected-explained.md) - the cost optimization pillar and its trade-offs

## Compare

- [Compute](../resources/service-comparison-compute.md) - the largest single cost line for most workloads
- [Storage](../resources/service-comparison-storage.md) - tiering, lifecycle, egress
- [Databases](https://data.noblerworks.com/resources/service-comparison-databases/) - managed DBs are cost-heavy; choosing right matters
