# AI/ML systems

The production-ML side of the AI stack: training infrastructure, model deployment, MLOps, feature stores, and the cloud platforms that orchestrate it. Where [LLMs and GenAI](./llms-and-genai.md) covers language-model specifics, this page covers the broader systems engineering: classical ML, deep learning, GPU infrastructure, ML pipelines, and the certs that test them.
