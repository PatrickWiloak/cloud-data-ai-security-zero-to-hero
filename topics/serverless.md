# Serverless

Serverless is the substrate of most modern cloud apps: pay-per-execution functions, container-based serverless, event triggers, scale-to-zero. This index brings together the concept, the architecture pattern, the hands-on build, the cross-cloud comparison, and the certs that hit serverless hardest.

  FN --> RES[Response or<br/>side effect]
  RT -. tear down after idle .-> Z[Zero cost when idle]

## Learn

- [Serverless explained](../learn/concepts/serverless-explained.md) - the model, FaaS vs container-based, cold starts
- [What is cloud computing?](../learn/concepts/what-is-cloud-computing.md) - elastic billing is the foundation
- [IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS](../learn/concepts/iaas-paas-saas.md) - where serverless sits in the stack
- [Containers vs VMs](../learn/concepts/containers-vs-vms.md) - what runs underneath
- [CI/CD explained](../learn/concepts/cicd-explained.md) - deploys for serverless are usually CI-driven
- [API gateways explained](../learn/concepts/api-gateways-explained.md) - the usual front door for functions
- [Message queues and pub/sub](../learn/concepts/message-queues-and-pub-sub-for-cloud.md) - the event sources functions consume

## Compare

- [Serverless services](../resources/service-comparison-serverless.md) - Lambda vs Functions vs Cloud Run vs Cloudflare Workers
- [Compute](../resources/service-comparison-compute.md) - where serverless fits next to VMs and containers
- [Messaging and queues](https://data.noblerworks.com/resources/service-comparison-messaging-queues/) - the event sources serverless functions consume

---

## Reference

- [Architecture pattern: serverless API](../resources/architecture-patterns/serverless-api.md) - clients → API gateway → functions → managed DB / queue
- [Architecture pattern: event-driven architecture](../resources/architecture-patterns/event-driven-architecture.md) - producer → broker → consumers, almost always serverless on the consumer side
- [Cost optimization: AWS](../resources/cost-optimization/aws-cost-optimization.md), [Azure](../resources/cost-optimization/azure-cost-optimization.md), [GCP](../resources/cost-optimization/gcp-cost-optimization.md) - serverless is often a cost-optimization lever

---

## Build

- [Build a serverless application](../resources/hands-on-projects/serverless-application.md) - API + queue + function + storage, event-driven
- [Build a CI/CD pipeline](../resources/hands-on-projects/build-ci-cd-pipeline.md) - serverless deploys via GitHub Actions
