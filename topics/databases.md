# Databases

SQL, NoSQL, vector databases, data warehouses, lakehouses. The choice is rarely "which database" - it's "which database for which workload."

```mermaid

  W{Workload}
  W -- transactional<br/>strong consistency --> SQL[Relational:<br/>RDS, Cloud SQL, Spanner]
  W -- key-value<br/>at scale --> KV[Wide-column:<br/>DynamoDB, Bigtable]
  W -- document<br/>flexible schema --> DOC[Document:<br/>Cosmos DB, Firestore, MongoDB]
  W -- semantic search<br/>RAG --> VEC[Vector:<br/>pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate]
  W -- analytics<br/>columnar --> OLAP[(Warehouse:<br/>BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake)]
  W -- streaming<br/>+ batch unified --> LH[Lakehouse:<br/>Databricks Delta / Iceberg]

## Learn

- [Eventual consistency](../learn/concepts/eventual-consistency.md) - CAP, when EC is fine, when it bites
- [Idempotency explained](../learn/concepts/idempotency-explained.md) - retries, idempotency keys, common patterns
- [Queues vs streams](../learn/concepts/queues-vs-streams.md) - SQS vs Kinesis (and equivalents), ordering, replay
- [Embeddings and vector search](../learn/concepts/embeddings-and-vector-search.md) - vector DB basics
- [Warehouses, lakes, and lakehouses](../learn/concepts/warehouses-lakes-lakehouses.md) - the analytical stores
- [Data modeling for analytics](../learn/concepts/data-modeling-for-analytics.md) - star schemas, grain, SCD types

For how data gets into these stores - pipelines, ETL/ELT, batch vs streaming, partitioning, quality - see the [Data engineering topic](./data-engineering.md).
