## Architecture Overview

### What is Active-Active Architecture?

Active-active architecture runs identical workloads in multiple regions simultaneously:
- **All Regions Active**: Every region handles production traffic
- **Global Load Balancing**: Traffic is routed to the nearest or healthiest region
- **Data Replication**: Data is synchronized across regions
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one region fails, others absorb the traffic
- **Low Latency**: Users are served from the closest region
- **High Availability**: No single region is a single point of failure

### Active-Active vs Active-Passive

| Aspect | Active-Active | Active-Passive |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Traffic** | All regions serve traffic | Only primary serves traffic |
| **Failover** | Automatic, near-instant | Requires failover process (minutes) |
| [**Latency**](../../learn/glossary.md#term-latency) | Low (nearest region) | Higher for distant users |
| **Cost** | Higher (full capacity in all regions) | Lower (standby can be scaled down) |
| **Complexity** | High (data sync, conflict resolution) | Moderate (one-way replication) |
| **Data Consistency** | Eventual (typically) | Strong (single primary) |
| **RPO** | Near zero | Depends on replication lag |
| **RTO** | Near zero | Minutes to hours |

### Benefits

- **Global Low Latency**: Users served from the nearest region
- **Maximum Availability**: Survives full region failures
- **Disaster Recovery Built-in**: No separate DR infrastructure needed
- **Scalability**: Distribute load across regions globally
- **Compliance**: Keep data in required geographic regions
- **No Failover Delay**: Traffic automatically reroutes on failure

### Trade-offs

- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency is the norm
- **Conflict Resolution**: Concurrent writes to same data must be handled
- **Cost**: Running full infrastructure in multiple regions
- **Complexity**: Cross-region networking, replication, and monitoring
- **Testing**: Must test region failure scenarios regularly
- **Debugging**: Distributed tracing across regions is challenging

### Use Cases

- Global SaaS platforms with worldwide users
- Financial services requiring extreme availability
- E-commerce with global customer base
- Gaming platforms with regional player servers
- IoT platforms processing data from global devices
- Content delivery and media streaming platforms

```

### Traffic Flow

1. User makes a request to the global DNS endpoint
2. DNS or global load balancer routes to the nearest healthy region
3. Regional load balancer distributes traffic across application instances
4. Application reads/writes to the local database replica
5. Database replication propagates changes to other regions
6. Conflict resolution handles concurrent modifications

## Data Replication Strategies

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

| Aspect | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Consistency** | Strong | Eventual |
| **Latency** | Higher (cross-region round trip) | Lower (local write only) |
| **Availability** | Lower (depends on remote region) | Higher (local write succeeds) |
| **Data Loss Risk** | None | Possible (replication lag) |
| **Use Case** | Financial transactions | User profiles, content |
| **Example** | Cloud Spanner | DynamoDB Global Tables |

### Replication Patterns

1. **Multi-Master**: All regions accept writes, conflicts resolved automatically
2. **Single-Primary**: One region for writes, others for reads with forwarding
3. **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: Data structures that merge without conflicts
4. **Event Sourcing**: Replicate events, rebuild state locally

### Cross-Region Database Options

| Database | Type | Replication | Consistency | Conflict Resolution |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| DynamoDB Global Tables | NoSQL | Async | Eventual | Last writer wins |
| Aurora Global Database | Relational | Async | Eventual (cross-region) | Single primary |
| Cosmos DB | Multi-model | Configurable | 5 levels | Configurable |
| Cloud Spanner | Relational | Sync (TrueTime) | Strong | Not needed |
| CockroachDB | Relational | Sync (Raft) | Strong | Not needed |

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Last Writer Wins** | Most recent timestamp wins | Simple | Data loss possible |
| **Application-Level** | Application logic resolves | Flexible | Complex to implement |
| **CRDTs** | Mathematically guaranteed merge | No conflicts | Limited data structures |
| **Strong Consistency** | Prevent conflicts via consensus | No conflicts | Higher latency |
| **Version Vectors** | Track causality of updates | Accurate conflict detection | Complex |

### Best Practices

- **Design for idempotency**: Ensure operations can be safely retried
- **Use unique IDs**: Generate globally unique identifiers (UUIDs, ULIDs)
- **Partition by region**: Assign data ownership to regions where possible
- **Event sourcing**: Record all changes as immutable events
- **Compensating transactions**: Handle conflicts with corrective operations

---

## Design Considerations

### Network Architecture

- **Inter-region connectivity**: Use cloud provider backbone (not public internet)
- **DNS TTL**: Set low TTLs (60s) for faster failover
- **Health checks**: Multi-layer health checks (TCP, HTTP, application-level)
- **Session handling**: Use regional sticky sessions or shared session stores

### Deployment Strategy

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Same templates deployed across all regions
- **Blue-green per region**: Update one region at a time
- **Feature flags**: Control feature rollout per region
- **Canary deployment**: Test changes in one region before global rollout

### Testing

- **Chaos engineering**: Regularly simulate region failures
- **Failover drills**: Test failover procedures quarterly
- **Latency testing**: Validate cross-region replication lag
- **Load testing**: Test each region can handle full global traffic
