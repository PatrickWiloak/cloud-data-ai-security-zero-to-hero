## Architecture Overview

### What is Lakehouse Architecture?

Lakehouse architecture combines the flexibility of data lakes with the performance and governance of data warehouses:
- **Open Storage**: Data stored in open formats on object storage (S3, ADLS, GCS)
- **ACID Transactions**: Full transactional support on data lake files
- **Schema Enforcement**: Schema-on-write with schema evolution support
- **Unified Platform**: Single architecture for BI, ML, streaming, and data engineering
- **Time Travel**: Query historical data at any point in time
- **Performance**: Indexing, caching, and query optimization on raw data

### Data Lake vs Data Warehouse vs Lakehouse

| Feature | Data Lake | Data Warehouse | Lakehouse |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Storage** | Object storage (cheap) | Proprietary (expensive) | Object storage (cheap) |
| **Data Types** | Structured, semi, unstructured | Structured only | All types |
| [**Schema**](../../learn/glossary.md#term-schema) | Schema-on-read | Schema-on-write | Both |
| [**ACID**](../../learn/glossary.md#term-acid) | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Performance** | Slow for SQL | Fast for SQL | Fast for SQL |
| **Cost** | Low storage, variable compute | High (coupled) | Low storage, elastic compute |
| **ML Support** | Native | Limited | Native |
| **Governance** | Limited | Strong | Strong |

### Benefits

- **Cost Efficiency**: Cheap object storage with elastic compute
- **Unified Analytics**: BI, data science, and streaming on one platform
- **Open Formats**: Avoid vendor lock-in with open table formats
- **ACID Compliance**: Reliable data operations with transactional guarantees
- **Time Travel**: Audit, rollback, and reproduce historical queries
- **Schema Evolution**: Safely evolve schemas without breaking downstream consumers
- **Performance**: Comparable to data warehouses for structured queries

### Trade-offs

- **Complexity**: More components to manage than a simple warehouse
- **Maturity**: Table format ecosystem is still evolving
- **Tooling**: Not all BI tools support lakehouse formats natively
- **Optimization**: Requires tuning (compaction, Z-ordering, partitioning)
- **Expertise**: Teams need to understand storage optimization techniques

## Design Considerations

### Partitioning Strategy

- **Time-based partitioning**: Most common; partition by date, hour, or month
- **Column-based partitioning**: Partition by high-cardinality columns (region, customer_id)
- **Hidden partitioning (Iceberg)**: Users query without knowing partition structure
- **Over-partitioning risk**: Too many small files degrades performance
- **Rule of thumb**: Aim for partition sizes of 100 MB to 1 GB

### File Size Optimization

- **Target file size**: 128 MB to 1 GB for Parquet files
- **Small file problem**: Too many small files causes slow queries and high metadata overhead
- **Compaction**: Run regular compaction jobs to merge small files
- **Auto-optimization**: Delta Lake auto-optimize, Iceberg automatic compaction

### Query Performance

- **Z-Ordering / Clustering**: Co-locate related data for faster range queries
- **Column statistics**: Maintain min/max statistics for data skipping
- **Caching**: Use SSD caching or query result caching for frequent queries
- **Materialized views**: Pre-compute common aggregations

---

## Schema Management

### Schema Enforcement

- **Schema-on-write**: Reject data that does not match the expected schema
- **Schema validation**: Validate at ingestion time to catch issues early
- **Data type enforcement**: Ensure correct data types for all columns
- **Not-null constraints**: Enforce required fields

### Schema Evolution

| Operation | Delta Lake | Iceberg | Hudi |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| **Add column** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Drop column** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Rename column** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Reorder columns** | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| **Widen type** | Yes (int to long) | Yes | Yes |
| **Change nullability** | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Best Practices

- **Backward compatibility**: Adding columns is safe; removing columns requires coordination
- **Versioned schemas**: Track schema changes in version control
- **Default values**: Use default values for new columns to avoid null issues
- **Schema registry**: Use a schema registry for streaming data (Avro, Protobuf)
- **Testing**: Validate schema changes against downstream consumers before deploying

### Time Travel and Versioning

- **Snapshot queries**: Query data as it existed at a specific point in time
- **Rollback**: Restore a table to a previous version if errors are detected
- **Audit**: Compare current data with historical versions for auditing
- **Retention**: Configure how long historical versions are retained (storage cost trade-off)
- **Reproducibility**: Re-run ML experiments against the exact same data

```sql
-- Delta Lake time travel
SELECT * FROM my_table VERSION AS OF 5;
SELECT * FROM my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-01';

-- Iceberg time travel
SELECT * FROM my_table FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01 00:00:00';

-- Rollback
RESTORE TABLE my_table TO VERSION AS OF 3;
```
