## Key Takeaways

1. **Azure Monitor** with Application Insights provides the most comprehensive single-platform APM experience
2. **CloudWatch** offers the deepest AWS integration but requires combining multiple services for full observability
3. **Google Cloud** provides the most generous free tier for logging (50 GB/month)
4. All three providers are converging on **OpenTelemetry** as the standard instrumentation framework
5. **Managed Prometheus** is available on all three platforms - PromQL skills are highly transferable
6. **KQL** (Azure) is the most powerful query language but has the steepest learning curve
7. For multi-cloud observability, consider third-party tools like Datadog, New Relic, or Grafana Cloud
8. Understanding log retention policies and archive strategies is critical for compliance exam questions
