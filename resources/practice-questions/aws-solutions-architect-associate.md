## Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures (30%)

### Question 1
**Scenario:** A company is migrating a web application to AWS. The application stores sensitive customer data and must comply with PCI DSS. The security team requires that data be encrypted at rest and in transit, with the company managing its own encryption keys.

A. Use S3 with SSE-S3 encryption and HTTPS
B. Use S3 with SSE-KMS using customer-managed keys and HTTPS
C. Use S3 with SSE-C and HTTP for internal traffic
D. Use S3 with client-side encryption only

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** SSE-KMS with customer-managed keys (CMKs) allows the company to control the encryption keys while meeting PCI DSS requirements for encryption at rest. HTTPS ensures encryption in transit. SSE-S3 uses AWS-managed keys. SSE-C requires customers to manage key transfer. Client-side encryption alone doesn't address transit encryption.

**Key Concept:** [S3 Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html)
</details>

---

### Question 2
**Scenario:** An application running on EC2 instances needs to access an S3 bucket. The security team requires that credentials should not be stored on the instances and should automatically rotate.

A. Store AWS access keys in environment variables
B. Use an IAM role attached to the EC2 instances
C. Store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve at startup
D. Embed credentials in the application code

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** IAM roles for EC2 provide temporary credentials that automatically rotate. The EC2 instance assumes the role and receives temporary credentials via the instance metadata service. This is the AWS best practice for granting permissions to EC2 instances.

**Key Concept:** [IAM Roles for EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)
</details>

---

### Question 3
**Scenario:** A company needs to allow users from their corporate Active Directory to access AWS resources without creating separate IAM users. Users should have different permissions based on their AD group membership.

A. Create IAM users for each AD user with matching permissions
B. Use AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) with AD integration
C. Share IAM access keys with AD administrators
D. Use Amazon Cognito User Pools

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) integrates with corporate Active Directory and allows mapping AD groups to AWS permission sets. Users authenticate with their existing AD credentials. Cognito is for customer identity, not employee federation.

**Key Concept:** [IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/)
</details>

---

### Question 4
**Scenario:** A web application receives traffic from the internet and needs protection against SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks. The application runs on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer.

A. Configure Security Groups to block malicious traffic
B. Deploy AWS WAF with ALB and configure managed rules
C. Enable AWS Shield Standard
D. Use Network ACLs to filter traffic

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** AWS WAF protects against common web exploits like SQL injection and XSS. It integrates with ALB and provides managed rule sets for common attacks. Security Groups and NACLs operate at layer 3/4 and can't inspect application-layer attacks. Shield protects against DDoS, not application attacks.

**Key Concept:** [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/)
</details>

---

### Question 5
**Scenario:** A company needs to ensure that only EC2 instances in a private subnet can access an S3 bucket, and the traffic should not traverse the internet.

A. Configure S3 bucket policy to allow only the VPC CIDR
B. Create a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3 and update route tables
C. Use NAT Gateway for S3 access
D. Configure Security Groups on EC2 to allow S3 access

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** A VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3 allows private connectivity to S3 without traversing the internet. Traffic stays within the AWS network. NAT Gateway still routes traffic over the internet. Security Groups don't control S3 access paths.

**Key Concept:** [VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html)
</details>

---

### Question 6
**Scenario:** An application needs to connect to an Amazon RDS database. The connection string contains the database password. The security team requires the password to be stored securely and rotated automatically every 30 days.

A. Store the password in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (Standard)
B. Store the password in AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation enabled
C. Store the password in an encrypted S3 object
D. Store the password in environment variables on EC2

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** AWS Secrets Manager supports automatic rotation of RDS credentials with built-in Lambda functions. It can rotate passwords according to a schedule. Parameter Store Standard doesn't support automatic rotation. S3 and environment variables don't provide rotation capabilities.

**Key Concept:** [Secrets Manager Rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html)
</details>

---

### Question 7
**Scenario:** A company wants to enforce that all S3 buckets in their AWS accounts have encryption enabled and block public access. They need a solution that works across multiple accounts.

A. Manually check each bucket and enable encryption
B. Use AWS Config rules with automatic remediation
C. Use AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs)
D. Use S3 Batch Operations

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** SCPs can prevent the creation of unencrypted buckets and enforce blocking public access across all accounts in an organization. AWS Config can detect non-compliant resources but SCPs provide preventive controls. Batch Operations work on existing objects, not bucket policies.

**Key Concept:** [Service Control Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)
</details>

---

### Question 8
**Scenario:** A company has deployed an API Gateway with Lambda backend. They need to ensure only authenticated users can access the API, and different users have different levels of access.

A. Use API keys for authentication
B. Use Lambda authorizers with JWT tokens
C. Make the API public and handle auth in Lambda
D. Use IAM authentication only

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Lambda authorizers can validate JWT tokens (from Cognito, Auth0, etc.) and return IAM policies that grant different levels of access based on user claims. API keys are for throttling, not authentication. IAM authentication is for AWS credentials, not end-user auth.

**Key Concept:** [API Gateway Authorizers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html)
</details>

---

### Question 9
**Scenario:** A company needs to detect when someone makes API calls from an IP address outside their approved corporate network. They need to be alerted within minutes.

A. Enable VPC Flow Logs and analyze with Athena
B. Configure CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs and set up metric filters
C. Use AWS Config to track API changes
D. Enable GuardDuty for threat detection

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** CloudTrail logs all API calls including source IP. Sending logs to CloudWatch Logs allows creating metric filters for specific IP ranges and setting alarms for near-real-time alerting. GuardDuty detects threats but with findings, not custom IP filtering.

**Key Concept:** [CloudTrail with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/monitor-cloudtrail-log-files-with-cloudwatch-logs.html)
</details>

---

### Question 10
**Scenario:** An application processes sensitive data and regulatory requirements mandate that encryption keys be stored in hardware security modules (HSMs) with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validation.

A. Use AWS KMS with standard keys
B. Use AWS CloudHSM
C. Use AWS KMS with imported key material
D. Use client-side encryption with OpenSSL

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** AWS CloudHSM provides dedicated HSMs with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validation, giving you full control over keys in tamper-resistant hardware. Standard KMS keys are Level 2 validated. Imported keys still use KMS infrastructure.

**Key Concept:** [AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/)
</details>

---

### Question 11
**Scenario:** A company runs an application that processes credit card data. They need to ensure EC2 instances are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

A. Use Amazon GuardDuty
B. Use Amazon Inspector
C. Use AWS Shield
D. Use AWS Trusted Advisor

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Amazon Inspector automatically assesses EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities and CVEs. GuardDuty detects threats from behavior patterns. Shield protects against DDoS. Trusted Advisor provides general best practice recommendations.

**Key Concept:** [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/)
</details>

---

### Question 12
**Scenario:** A company wants to prevent accidental deletion of an S3 bucket that contains critical compliance data. Even administrators should not be able to delete it without additional approval.

A. Enable S3 versioning
B. Enable MFA Delete on the bucket
C. Create a bucket policy denying delete
D. Enable S3 Object Lock in Governance mode

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** MFA Delete requires multi-factor authentication to delete the bucket or change versioning state. This adds an extra layer of protection even for administrators. Object Lock prevents object deletion but not bucket deletion. Versioning preserves data but doesn't prevent deletion.

**Key Concept:** [MFA Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete.html)
</details>

---

## Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures (26%)

### Question 13
**Scenario:** A company needs to deploy a web application that can survive the failure of an entire Availability Zone. The application uses an RDS MySQL database and stores user-uploaded files.

A. Deploy EC2 in one AZ, RDS Single-AZ, S3 for files
B. Deploy EC2 in multiple AZs with ALB, RDS Multi-AZ, S3 for files
C. Deploy EC2 in one AZ with Auto Scaling, RDS Read Replica, EBS for files
D. Deploy EC2 in multiple Regions, RDS Cross-Region Replica, S3 for files

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Multi-AZ deployment with ALB distributes traffic across AZs. RDS Multi-AZ provides automatic failover to standby in another AZ. S3 is inherently multi-AZ durable. This architecture survives single AZ failure without manual intervention.

**Key Concept:** [Multi-AZ Deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html)
</details>

---

### Question 14
**Scenario:** An application must achieve a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 15 minutes and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour for disaster recovery to another AWS Region.

A. Backup and Restore strategy
B. Pilot Light strategy
C. Warm Standby strategy
D. Multi-site Active-Active

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Warm Standby maintains a scaled-down but fully functional copy of the production environment in the DR region. It can be scaled up quickly to meet the 15-minute RTO. Pilot Light (minimal resources) would take longer to scale. Backup/Restore has hours of RTO. Multi-site is costlier than needed.

**Key Concept:** [DR Strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html)
</details>

---

### Question 15
**Scenario:** A company runs a critical application on EC2 instances. They need to automatically replace unhealthy instances and maintain a minimum number of running instances at all times.

A. Use a Network Load Balancer
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to restart instances
C. Use Auto Scaling Group with health checks
D. Use AWS Lambda to monitor and replace instances

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Auto Scaling Groups can perform health checks (EC2 or ELB health checks) and automatically terminate and replace unhealthy instances while maintaining the desired capacity. This is the native, managed solution for instance resilience.

**Key Concept:** [Auto Scaling Health Checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/healthcheck.html)
</details>

---

### Question 16
**Scenario:** A company has a legacy application that cannot be modified to run across multiple servers. They need high availability with automatic failover.

A. Deploy to multiple AZs with load balancer
B. Use EC2 Auto Recovery with CloudWatch alarms
C. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk
D. Deploy multiple instances and sync manually

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** EC2 Auto Recovery can automatically recover an instance when underlying hardware fails, maintaining the same instance ID, IP addresses, and EBS volumes. This works for single-instance applications that can't be load balanced.

**Key Concept:** [EC2 Auto Recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html)
</details>

---

### Question 17
**Scenario:** An application uses Amazon SQS to decouple components. Messages must not be lost, and duplicate processing must be prevented.

A. Use SQS Standard queue with visibility timeout
B. Use SQS FIFO queue with message deduplication
C. Use Amazon SNS for message delivery
D. Use SQS Standard queue with dead-letter queue

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** SQS FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once processing and maintain message order. Message deduplication prevents duplicate messages within a 5-minute interval. Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery (possible duplicates).

**Key Concept:** [SQS FIFO Queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html)
</details>

---

### Question 18
**Scenario:** A company needs to design a database solution that automatically replicates data synchronously across three Availability Zones and can handle 100,000 read queries per second.

A. Amazon RDS MySQL with Read Replicas
B. Amazon Aurora with Aurora Replicas
C. Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables
D. Amazon ElastiCache Redis cluster

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Aurora stores data across three AZs synchronously and supports up to 15 Aurora Replicas for read scaling. Aurora Replicas share the same storage layer, providing both durability and read scalability. RDS Read Replicas use async replication.

**Key Concept:** [Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html)
</details>

---

### Question 19
**Scenario:** An e-commerce application experiences traffic spikes during flash sales. Orders must not be lost if the database becomes temporarily unavailable.

A. Scale up the database before sales
B. Use SQS to queue orders and process asynchronously
C. Deploy read replicas for the database
D. Use ElastiCache to buffer writes

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** SQS acts as a buffer between the application and database. Orders are reliably stored in the queue and processed as the database becomes available. This decoupling prevents order loss during database outages or overload.

**Key Concept:** [Decoupling with SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-basic-architecture.html)
</details>

---

### Question 20
**Scenario:** A company runs a critical workload on EC2 instances. They need to minimize data loss if an instance fails, requiring the most durable storage option.

A. Instance store volumes
B. EBS volumes with daily snapshots
C. EBS io2 volumes with Multi-Attach
D. EBS volumes with continuous replication to S3

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** EBS volumes persist independently of EC2 instances and provide 99.999% durability. Daily snapshots to S3 provide point-in-time recovery. Instance store data is lost when instances stop. io2 Multi-Attach is for shared access, not additional durability.

**Key Concept:** [EBS Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html)
</details>

---

### Question 21
**Scenario:** A media company needs to store video files that are frequently accessed for the first 30 days, then rarely accessed, and must be retained for 7 years for compliance.

A. Store in S3 Standard, manually move to Glacier after 30 days
B. Store in S3 Standard with lifecycle policy to S3 Standard-IA at 30 days, Glacier at 90 days
C. Store in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
D. Store in S3 One Zone-IA

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** S3 lifecycle policies automate transitioning objects between storage classes based on age. Standard for hot access, Standard-IA for infrequent, Glacier for long-term archival. This optimizes cost while meeting retention requirements.

**Key Concept:** [S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)
</details>

---

### Question 22
**Scenario:** A company needs their application to fail over to a different AWS Region if the primary Region becomes unavailable. DNS-based failover is acceptable.

A. Use Application Load Balancer cross-region
B. Use Route 53 health checks with failover routing
C. Use AWS Global Accelerator
D. Use CloudFront with multiple origins

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Route 53 failover routing with health checks can automatically route traffic to a healthy Region if the primary Region fails. ALB doesn't work cross-region. Global Accelerator provides performance optimization but Route 53 is the standard DR solution.

**Key Concept:** [Route 53 Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html)
</details>

## Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures (24%)

### Question 23
**Scenario:** A mobile gaming company needs a database that provides single-digit millisecond latency for player session data with millions of concurrent users and unpredictable traffic patterns.

A. Amazon RDS with Provisioned IOPS
B. Amazon Aurora Serverless
C. Amazon DynamoDB with on-demand capacity
D. Amazon ElastiCache Redis

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** DynamoDB provides consistent single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. On-demand capacity handles unpredictable traffic without capacity planning. It's purpose-built for this use case. RDS/Aurora have higher latency. ElastiCache could work but DynamoDB is more scalable.

**Key Concept:** [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
</details>

---

### Question 24
**Scenario:** A company runs a read-heavy application with an RDS MySQL database. Read latency is increasing as traffic grows. They need to reduce read latency without changing application code significantly.

A. Enable RDS Multi-AZ
B. Add RDS Read Replicas and configure application to read from replicas
C. Deploy ElastiCache in front of the database
D. Migrate to Aurora

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** ElastiCache can cache frequently accessed data, dramatically reducing read latency with minimal code changes (cache-aside pattern). Read Replicas help but require application changes to route reads. Multi-AZ is for availability, not performance.

**Key Concept:** [ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)
</details>

---

### Question 25
**Scenario:** A company needs to process 10TB of data daily from S3, running complex SQL queries for business intelligence. Query results should be available within minutes.

A. Use Amazon RDS to import and query data
B. Use Amazon Athena with partitioned data
C. Use Amazon Redshift with S3 data loading
D. Use AWS Glue to transform data

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Redshift is designed for large-scale data warehousing and complex analytical queries. It can efficiently load and query terabytes of data. Athena is serverless but may be slower for complex queries on this scale. Glue is for ETL, not querying.

**Key Concept:** [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)
</details>

---

### Question 26
**Scenario:** A company hosts a static website with global users. They need to minimize latency for users regardless of their geographic location.

A. Deploy EC2 instances in multiple Regions with Route 53 geolocation routing
B. Host on S3 with CloudFront distribution
C. Use AWS Global Accelerator with ALB
D. Deploy to multiple Regions with Route 53 latency-based routing

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** CloudFront caches static content at 400+ edge locations worldwide, serving content from the nearest location to users. This is the most cost-effective and performant solution for static websites. EC2 for static content is unnecessary overhead.

**Key Concept:** [CloudFront with S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.SimpleDistribution.html)
</details>

---

### Question 27
**Scenario:** An application needs to process messages from an SQS queue. Processing time varies from 1 second to 5 minutes. The company wants to scale processing capacity based on queue depth.

A. Use Lambda with SQS trigger
B. Use EC2 instances polling SQS with Auto Scaling based on ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible
C. Use AWS Step Functions
D. Use Fargate tasks triggered by SQS

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Lambda has a 15-minute timeout, but message processing up to 5 minutes is within limits. However, EC2 with Auto Scaling based on queue depth provides more control for variable processing times and can scale based on backlog. For 5-minute processing, Lambda would work but EC2 gives more flexibility.

Note: Lambda would also be acceptable for this scenario since 5 minutes is within the 15-minute limit. The question emphasizes scaling based on queue depth, which both solutions support.

**Key Concept:** [SQS-based Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html)
</details>

---

### Question 28
**Scenario:** A video streaming service needs to deliver live video to viewers worldwide with the lowest possible latency. Videos are encoded in real-time.

A. Amazon S3 with CloudFront
B. AWS Elemental MediaLive with MediaPackage and CloudFront
C. EC2 instances running custom streaming software
D. Amazon Kinesis Video Streams

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** MediaLive encodes live video, MediaPackage packages it for delivery, and CloudFront distributes it globally with low latency. This is the AWS solution purpose-built for live video streaming. S3/CloudFront is for VOD. Kinesis Video is for video analytics.

**Key Concept:** [AWS Media Services](https://aws.amazon.com/media-services/)
</details>

---

### Question 29
**Scenario:** A company needs to transfer 50TB of data from an on-premises data center to AWS. Their internet connection is 100 Mbps, and they need the data transferred within one week.

A. Transfer over the internet using multiple threads
B. Use AWS Snowball
C. Set up AWS Direct Connect
D. Use AWS DataSync over VPN

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** At 100 Mbps, transferring 50TB would take approximately 46 days. Snowball can be delivered, loaded, and returned within a week. Direct Connect takes weeks to provision. DataSync over limited bandwidth would be too slow.

**Key Concept:** [AWS Snowball](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/)
</details>

---

### Question 30
**Scenario:** A company runs a REST API on EC2 instances. API response times are acceptable, but they want to reduce EC2 costs while maintaining performance for their predictable traffic patterns.

A. Use Spot Instances
B. Use Lambda with API Gateway
C. Use Reserved Instances
D. Use Savings Plans

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** For REST APIs, Lambda with API Gateway eliminates EC2 management and costs nothing when idle. You pay only for actual invocations. Since traffic is predictable, Lambda can handle it efficiently. Spot isn't suitable for APIs (interruptions). Reserved/Savings Plans still pay for idle capacity.

**Key Concept:** [API Gateway with Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-lambda-integration.html)
</details>

---

### Question 31
**Scenario:** A data analytics application needs to process large datasets using Apache Spark. The workload runs for 2 hours daily and must complete within a 3-hour window.

A. Run Spark on EC2 instances running 24/7
B. Use Amazon EMR with spot instances
C. Use AWS Glue for Spark jobs
D. Use Amazon Redshift

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** EMR supports Apache Spark and can use Spot Instances for cost savings on batch workloads. Clusters can be spun up for the job and terminated after. Glue is serverless Spark but may be costlier for known 2-hour jobs. Running EC2 24/7 is wasteful for 2-hour daily jobs.

**Key Concept:** [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/)
</details>

---

### Question 32
**Scenario:** A company needs to serve API traffic to users globally. They want to improve performance by reducing connection latency, especially for users far from the AWS Region.

A. Deploy to multiple Regions with Route 53 latency routing
B. Use CloudFront with API Gateway origin
C. Use AWS Global Accelerator
D. Use larger EC2 instances

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Global Accelerator provides static anycast IP addresses and routes traffic through AWS's global network to the optimal endpoint. It reduces latency for TCP/UDP traffic including APIs. CloudFront is primarily for cacheable content. Multi-region adds operational complexity.

**Key Concept:** [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/)

## Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures (20%)

### Question 33
**Scenario:** A company runs batch processing jobs on EC2 instances. Jobs can be interrupted and restarted without data loss. They run for 4-6 hours and execute 3 times per week.

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Reserved Instances (1-year)
C. Spot Instances with checkpointing
D. Dedicated Hosts

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Spot Instances offer up to 90% discount for interruptible workloads. Since the batch jobs can handle interruptions (with checkpointing to save progress), Spot is ideal. Reserved Instances aren't cost-effective for 12-18 hours/week usage.

**Key Concept:** [Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)
</details>

---

### Question 34
**Scenario:** A company stores 100TB of data in S3. 90% of the data hasn't been accessed in over a year but must be retained for compliance. They want to reduce storage costs.

A. Delete the unused data
B. Move infrequently accessed data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive
C. Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering
D. Move all data to S3 One Zone-IA

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest-cost storage class for data that rarely needs access (retrieval within 12-48 hours is acceptable). For compliance data accessed less than yearly, this provides maximum savings. One Zone-IA risks data loss. Intelligent-Tiering has overhead for this scale.

**Key Concept:** [S3 Glacier Deep Archive](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/)
</details>

---

### Question 35
**Scenario:** A company runs multiple production workloads on EC2. They can commit to using specific instance types for 3 years. What provides the maximum cost savings?

A. Compute Savings Plans
B. EC2 Instance Savings Plans
C. Reserved Instances (3-year, All Upfront)
D. Spot Instances

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** 3-year Reserved Instances with All Upfront payment provide the maximum discount (up to 72% off On-Demand). If they can commit to specific instance types and know their capacity needs, RIs provide the best savings. Savings Plans offer more flexibility but slightly less discount.

**Key Concept:** [Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/)
</details>

---

### Question 36
**Scenario:** A company wants to identify unused or underutilized EC2 instances and get recommendations to right-size them.

A. AWS Cost Explorer with Resource Optimization
B. AWS Budgets
C. AWS Compute Optimizer
D. AWS Pricing Calculator

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** AWS Compute Optimizer analyzes CloudWatch metrics and provides recommendations for right-sizing EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and Lambda functions. Cost Explorer shows costs but doesn't analyze utilization. Budgets tracks spending against thresholds.

**Key Concept:** [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/)
</details>

---

### Question 37
**Scenario:** A company has variable compute needs that fluctuate hourly. They want cost savings but need flexibility to change instance types and sizes as requirements evolve.

A. Reserved Instances
B. Compute Savings Plans
C. Spot Instances
D. Dedicated Hosts

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Compute Savings Plans provide up to 66% savings and automatically apply to any instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or Region. This flexibility is ideal for evolving requirements. Reserved Instances lock you to specific instance types.

**Key Concept:** [Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/)
</details>

---

### Question 38
**Scenario:** A company runs an internal application used only during business hours (8 AM - 6 PM, Monday-Friday). EC2 instances currently run 24/7.

A. Use Reserved Instances
B. Use AWS Instance Scheduler to stop instances outside business hours
C. Move to Lambda
D. Use Spot Instances

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** AWS Instance Scheduler can automatically start and stop EC2 instances based on schedules. Stopping instances during off-hours (128 hours/week vs 50 hours used) saves ~60% on compute costs. RIs still pay for unused time.

**Key Concept:** [Instance Scheduler](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/instance-scheduler/)
</details>

---

### Question 39
**Scenario:** A company has multiple development and test environments that are often idle. They want to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to quickly spin up environments when needed.

A. Use smaller instance types for all environments
B. Use AWS CloudFormation to create/delete environments on demand
C. Move all environments to a single shared instance
D. Use Reserved Instances for dev/test

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** CloudFormation (or Terraform) allows environments to be defined as code and created/deleted on demand. Pay only for resources when actually needed. Reserved Instances aren't suitable for intermittent use. Sharing instances creates conflicts.

**Key Concept:** [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)

### Question 40
**Scenario:** A company uses Amazon RDS for a production database. The database is heavily used during business hours but has minimal activity overnight and weekends.

A. Use RDS Reserved Instances
B. Stop the RDS instance during off-hours
C. Use Aurora Serverless
D. Use smaller instance during off-hours

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Aurora Serverless automatically scales capacity based on demand and can scale to zero during periods of no activity. This is ideal for variable workloads with significant idle time. Stopping RDS loses data if not using Aurora. Manual scaling is operationally complex.

**Key Concept:** [Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/)
