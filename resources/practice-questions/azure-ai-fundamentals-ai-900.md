## Domain 2: Describe Fundamental Principles of Machine Learning on Azure (Questions 8-16)

### Question 8
**Scenario:** A real estate company wants to predict house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms. The price is a continuous numeric value. What type of machine learning task is this?

A. Classification
B. Regression - predicting a continuous numeric value
C. Clustering
D. Reinforcement learning

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Regression predicts continuous numeric values. Since house prices can be any dollar amount (not discrete categories), this is a regression problem. The model learns relationships between features (size, location) and the target variable (price) to predict prices for new houses.

**Key Concept:** [Regression](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-regression-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/)
</details>

### Question 9
**Scenario:** A bank wants to build a model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or denied. The outcome is one of two categories. What type of machine learning task is this?

A. Regression
B. Binary Classification - predicting one of two categories (approved/denied)
C. Clustering
D. Computer vision

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Binary classification predicts one of two possible classes (yes/no, approved/denied, spam/not spam). The model learns patterns in historical loan data (features like income, credit score) to predict which class new applications belong to.

**Key Concept:** [Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-classification-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/)
</details>

### Question 10
**Scenario:** A marketing team has customer data but doesn't know how many customer segments exist or what defines them. They want the model to find natural groupings in the data. What type of machine learning task is this?

A. Classification
B. Regression
C. Clustering - finding natural groupings in unlabeled data
D. Object detection

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Clustering is unsupervised learning that finds natural groups in data without predefined labels. The algorithm identifies patterns and similarities, grouping similar customers together. Unlike classification, you don't tell the model what groups exist - it discovers them.

**Key Concept:** [Clustering](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/)
</details>

### Question 11
**Scenario:** A data scientist is building a machine learning model. They split their data into training data (to train the model) and test data (to evaluate it). Why is this split important?

A. To reduce storage costs
B. To evaluate model performance on data it hasn't seen during training, measuring generalization ability
C. To speed up training
D. The split is not important

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** The train/test split evaluates how well a model generalizes to new data. If you evaluate on training data, you can't tell if the model learned patterns or just memorized. Test data simulates real-world scenarios where the model sees new data. This reveals overfitting problems.

**Key Concept:** [Model Training and Evaluation](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-regression-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/6-evaluate-model)
</details>

### Question 12
**Scenario:** After training a classification model to detect email spam, a data scientist evaluates it and finds: 95% accuracy, but the model correctly identifies only 60% of actual spam emails. Which metric captures this spam detection performance?

A. Accuracy
B. Recall (Sensitivity) - the percentage of actual positive cases correctly identified
C. Precision
D. F1 score

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Recall (also called sensitivity or true positive rate) measures what percentage of actual positive cases (spam) the model correctly identifies. High accuracy can be misleading when classes are imbalanced. If 95% of emails are not spam, predicting "not spam" always gives 95% accuracy but 0% recall for spam.

**Key Concept:** [Model Metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-classification-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/5-evaluate-model)
</details>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Temperature is a parameter that controls randomness in generative AI outputs. Low temperature (0-0.3) produces more deterministic, focused responses - good for factual Q&A. High temperature (0.7-1.0) produces more creative, varied responses - good for creative writing. It affects the probability distribution of token selection.

<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Image generation models like DALL-E (available through Azure OpenAI) create images from text descriptions (prompts). You describe what you want ("a cat wearing a spacesuit on Mars") and the model generates a corresponding image. This is text-to-image generative AI.
