## Domain 1: Cloud Concepts (24%)

### Question 1
**Scenario:** A startup wants to launch a new application but doesn't want to invest in physical servers or predict capacity needs upfront. They want to pay only for the resources they actually use.

A. Traditional on-premises data center
B. Colocation hosting
C. Cloud computing
D. Dedicated hosting

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Cloud computing enables on-demand access to computing resources with pay-as-you-go pricing, eliminating the need for upfront capital investment. On-premises, colocation, and dedicated hosting all require capacity planning and upfront investment.

**Key Concept:** [What is Cloud Computing?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)
</details>

### Question 2
**Scenario:** A company wants to run their applications in AWS but maintain complete control over the operating system, including patches and security updates.

A. Software as a Service (SaaS)
B. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
C. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
D. Function as a Service (FaaS)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** IaaS provides virtualized computing resources where the customer manages the operating system, middleware, and applications. SaaS provides complete applications. PaaS manages the OS for you. FaaS abstracts infrastructure entirely.

**Key Concept:** [Cloud Computing Models](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)
</details>

### Question 3
**Scenario:** A company is evaluating whether to migrate to AWS. They currently spend $500,000 annually on data center operations including staff, power, cooling, and hardware maintenance. Which cloud benefit addresses this?

A. High availability
B. Elasticity
C. Trade capital expense for variable expense
D. Global reach

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Cloud computing allows companies to replace large capital investments (CapEx) in data centers with variable operational expenses (OpEx) that scale with usage. This eliminates the need for upfront hardware purchases and ongoing maintenance costs.

**Key Concept:** [Six Advantages of Cloud Computing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html)
</details>

### Question 4
**Scenario:** An e-commerce website experiences 10x normal traffic during holiday sales but returns to baseline afterward. What cloud computing benefit helps handle this situation cost-effectively?

A. Fault tolerance
B. Elasticity
C. Disaster recovery
D. Security

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Elasticity is the ability to automatically scale resources up during high demand and scale down during low demand. This ensures you only pay for what you use while meeting demand spikes.

**Key Concept:** [Elasticity](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.elasticity.en.html)

### Question 5
**Scenario:** A company needs to deploy their application closer to users in Asia-Pacific to reduce latency. Which AWS concept enables this?

A. Availability Zones
B. Edge Locations
C. AWS Regions
D. Local Zones

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** AWS Regions are geographic locations around the world where AWS has data centers. Deploying to an Asia-Pacific region brings the application closer to users in that area. Availability Zones are within regions. Edge Locations are for content delivery. Local Zones extend regions for specific cities.

**Key Concept:** [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
</details>

---

### Question 6
**Scenario:** A company requires their application to remain available even if a single data center experiences a failure. What should they use?

A. Single Availability Zone deployment
B. Multiple Availability Zones in one Region
C. Edge Locations
D. AWS Outposts

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within a Region with independent power, cooling, and networking. Deploying across multiple AZs provides high availability and fault tolerance against single data center failures.

**Key Concept:** [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)
</details>

A. AWS
B. The customer
C. Shared between AWS and customer
D. Third-party security provider

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Under the Shared Responsibility Model, customers are responsible for "security IN the cloud," which includes patching guest operating systems on EC2 instances. AWS is responsible for "security OF the cloud" - the underlying infrastructure.

**Key Concept:** [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
</details>

---

### Question 12
**Scenario:** A company needs to grant temporary access to an external auditor to review their AWS resources. What is the MOST secure approach?

B. Share the root account credentials
C. Create an IAM role with specific permissions
D. Create an IAM user with no MFA

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** IAM roles provide temporary credentials and can be assumed when needed. This follows the principle of least privilege and avoids creating permanent credentials. Never share root credentials, and always use MFA.

**Key Concept:** [IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)

A. AWS enables it automatically
B. The customer must enable it
C. Third-party tools are required
D. S3 data cannot be encrypted

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** While AWS provides encryption capabilities (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C), the customer is responsible for enabling and configuring encryption under the Shared Responsibility Model. Note: AWS now enables SSE-S3 by default for new buckets, but customers still manage encryption settings.

**Key Concept:** [S3 Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html)
</details>

---

### Question 15
**Scenario:** Which service should be used to manage encryption keys for AWS services?

A. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
B. AWS Secrets Manager
C. AWS KMS
D. Amazon S3 with encryption

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** AWS Secrets Manager is specifically designed for storing, rotating, and managing secrets like database credentials. It supports automatic rotation. Parameter Store stores configuration data but has limited rotation capabilities. KMS manages encryption keys, not secrets.

**Key Concept:** [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
