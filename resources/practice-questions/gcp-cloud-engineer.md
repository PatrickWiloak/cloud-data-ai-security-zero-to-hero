## Setting Up a Cloud Solution Environment (17.5%)

### Question 1
**Scenario:** A company is starting to use Google Cloud and needs to organize resources for three departments: Marketing, Engineering, and Sales. Each department should have separate billing and resource management. What is the recommended approach?

A. Create one project with three folders
B. Create three separate projects
C. Create one organization with three folders, each containing projects
D. Create three billing accounts with shared projects

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** The recommended approach is to use an organization with folders for each department. Folders provide grouping for policy inheritance and management, while projects within folders enable separate resource management. This follows GCP's resource hierarchy best practices. Single projects don't provide isolation. Folders can't exist at the project level. Shared projects with multiple billing accounts create complexity.

**Key Concept:** [Resource Hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy)
</details>

---

### Question 2
**Scenario:** A developer needs to use the gcloud CLI to manage resources in a specific project. They have access to multiple projects. How should they configure gcloud to work with the correct project?

A. Set the GOOGLE_PROJECT environment variable
B. Run `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`
C. Edit the ~/.gcloud/config file manually
D. Add --project flag to every command

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID` sets the default project for all subsequent gcloud commands. While --project flag works, it's not efficient for repeated use. The environment variable is GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, not GOOGLE_PROJECT. Manual config editing is not recommended.

**Key Concept:** [gcloud CLI Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/config/set)
</details>

---

### Question 3
**Scenario:** A company needs to grant a contractor temporary access to view Cloud Storage buckets in a specific project for an audit. The access should expire in 30 days. What should be configured?

A. Add the contractor to a Google Group with storage.objectViewer role
B. Grant storage.objectViewer role with an IAM condition for time-based access
C. Create a service account and share credentials
D. Grant storage.admin role temporarily

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** IAM conditions allow time-based access expiration. Granting the storage.objectViewer role with a condition specifying access expiration after 30 days meets the requirements. Google Groups don't expire. Service account credentials can be shared indefinitely. Admin role grants more than necessary.

**Key Concept:** [IAM Conditions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview)
</details>

---

### Question 4
**Scenario:** An organization needs to ensure that no resources are created in certain regions due to data residency requirements. How can they enforce this across all projects?

A. Configure VPC firewall rules
B. Set organization policies with location constraints
C. Use Cloud Armor policies
D. Configure Cloud NAT for specific regions

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Organization policies with location constraints (resource location restriction) enforce where resources can be created across the organization. Firewall rules control network traffic, not resource creation. Cloud Armor protects applications. Cloud NAT provides outbound connectivity.

**Key Concept:** [Organization Policies](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview)
</details>

---

### Question 5
**Scenario:** A team needs to create multiple identical environments (dev, staging, prod) with the same infrastructure configuration. What tool should they use?

A. Cloud Console
B. Deployment Manager or Terraform
C. gcloud CLI scripts only
D. Cloud Marketplace

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Deployment Manager (GCP-native) or Terraform (multi-cloud) provides infrastructure as code for creating repeatable, version-controlled environments. Console is manual. CLI scripts lack state management and idempotency. Marketplace is for pre-built solutions.

**Key Concept:** [Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs)
</details>

---

### Question 6
**Scenario:** A company wants to monitor and control cloud spending with alerts when costs exceed budgets. What should they configure?

A. Cloud Monitoring alerts
B. Cloud Billing budgets and alerts
C. Quotas and limits
D. Organization policies

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Cloud Billing budgets allow setting spending thresholds with alerts when actual or forecasted spending approaches or exceeds the budget. Cloud Monitoring tracks performance, not costs. Quotas limit resource creation. Organization policies enforce compliance rules.

**Key Concept:** [Cloud Billing Budgets](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets)
</details>

### Question 9
**Scenario:** A company needs to store 100 TB of data that will be accessed about once per year for compliance purposes. Cost is the primary concern. What storage option should they choose?

A. Cloud Storage Standard
B. Cloud Storage Nearline
C. Cloud Storage Coldline
D. Cloud Storage Archive

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: D**

**Why:** Cloud Storage Archive is the lowest-cost option for data accessed less than once per year. Nearline is for monthly access. Coldline is for quarterly access. Standard is for frequently accessed data. Archive's minimum storage duration (365 days) matches the annual access pattern.

**Key Concept:** [Cloud Storage Classes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes)
</details>

A. Cloud Tasks
B. Pub/Sub
C. Cloud Functions
D. Cloud Run

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Pub/Sub can handle millions of messages with exactly-once delivery guarantees and integrates with push notification services. Cloud Tasks is for task queuing. Cloud Functions and Cloud Run are compute services, not messaging.

**Key Concept:** [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs)
</details>

---

### Question 14
**Scenario:** A startup needs to deploy a containerized web application quickly without managing servers or Kubernetes clusters. They need automatic scaling to zero when idle to minimize costs. What should they use?

A. Compute Engine
B. GKE Standard
C. Cloud Run
D. App Engine Flexible

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** Cloud Run is a serverless container platform that automatically scales, including to zero, with pay-per-use pricing. Compute Engine requires VM management. GKE requires cluster management. App Engine Flexible doesn't scale to zero.

**Key Concept:** [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs)
</details>

## Deploying and Implementing a Cloud Solution (25%)

### Question 15
**Scenario:** A developer needs to deploy a Compute Engine VM from a custom image. The VM should automatically restart if it fails. How should this be configured?

A. Create an instance template and unmanaged instance group
B. Create an instance template and managed instance group
C. Create a single VM with automatic restart enabled
D. Use Kubernetes with node auto-repair

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** A managed instance group (MIG) with an instance template automatically recreates failed VMs to maintain the desired count. While single VMs can restart, MIGs provide better reliability. Unmanaged instance groups don't auto-heal. Kubernetes is for containers.

**Key Concept:** [Managed Instance Groups](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-managed-instances)
</details>

---

### Question 16
**Scenario:** A developer needs to deploy a containerized application to GKE. The application needs 2 replicas with a load balancer. What Kubernetes resources should be created?

A. Deployment and Service (type: LoadBalancer)
B. Pod and Service (type: ClusterIP)
C. StatefulSet and Ingress
D. DaemonSet and NodePort Service

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: A**

**Why:** A Deployment manages replicas (2 pods), and a Service with type LoadBalancer creates a GCP load balancer to distribute traffic. Pods alone don't provide replica management. ClusterIP is internal only. StatefulSet is for stateful apps. DaemonSet runs on all nodes.

**Key Concept:** [GKE Deployments and Services](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service)
</details>
