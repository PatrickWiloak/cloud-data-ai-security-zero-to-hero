**Correct: B**

**Why:** Infrastructure as Code treats infrastructure configuration like software code - stored in version control, reviewed through pull requests, and deployed consistently. Terraform (multi-cloud) and Deployment Manager (Google Cloud native) are IaC tools. This reduces configuration drift, enables disaster recovery, and supports DevOps practices.

### Question 39
**Scenario:** A global company wants to ensure their application is highly available and provides good performance for users worldwide. If one region fails, users should be automatically redirected to healthy regions. What Google Cloud feature enables this?

A. Single region deployment
B. Global HTTP(S) Load Balancing that routes users to the nearest healthy backend across regions
C. Manual DNS changes during outages
D. Accept regional outages

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Google Cloud Global Load Balancing provides a single anycast IP that routes requests to the nearest healthy backend based on user location and backend health. If a region fails, traffic automatically routes to other regions. This provides high availability and low latency globally without DNS changes.
