## Domain 1: Design Identity, Governance, and Monitoring Solutions (Questions 1-11)

### Question 1
**Scenario:** A multinational company is moving to Azure and needs to design an identity solution. They have 50,000 employees with on-premises Active Directory, multiple third-party SaaS applications requiring SSO, and need to support B2B collaboration with partners. What identity solution should they implement?

A. Azure AD with Azure AD Connect using password hash sync, Enterprise Applications for SSO, and Azure AD B2B
B. Migrate all users to cloud-only Azure AD accounts
C. Federation with AD FS only
D. Azure AD B2C for all users

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: A**

**Why:** This comprehensive approach addresses all requirements: Azure AD Connect syncs existing AD identities (password hash sync is simplest and most resilient). Enterprise Applications provide SSO to SaaS apps via SAML/OIDC. Azure AD B2B enables partner collaboration with their own identities. Cloud-only accounts (B) require recreating all users. AD FS only (C) doesn't provide SaaS SSO natively. B2C (D) is for customer-facing apps, not employees.

**Key Concept:** [Hybrid Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity)
</details>

**Why:** Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool is designed for data warehousing with MPP (massively parallel processing) architecture for complex queries. It handles 50TB efficiently with columnar storage and query optimization. Native Power BI integration provides fast visualizations. Azure SQL (A) isn't designed for data warehouse workloads. Cosmos DB (C) is for operational data. MySQL (D) isn't MPP.

**Key Concept:** [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is)
</details>

### Question 17
**Scenario:** A company needs to ensure data stored in Azure is encrypted with keys they control. They need to rotate keys annually and have audit logs of all key usage. What should they design?

A. Microsoft-managed keys (default)
B. Customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault with automatic rotation and diagnostic logging
C. Client-side encryption only
D. No encryption

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Customer-managed keys (CMK) stored in Key Vault provide customer control. Key Vault supports automatic key rotation policies. Diagnostic logs capture all key operations for auditing. Storage services (Blob, SQL, etc.) can be configured to use CMKs. Microsoft-managed (A) doesn't provide customer control. Client-side (C) is additional, not replacement. No encryption (D) violates security requirements.

**Key Concept:** [Customer-Managed Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/customer-managed-keys-overview)
</details>

### Question 18
**Scenario:** A company needs to replicate critical data to a secondary region for disaster recovery. The data must be readable in the secondary region during normal operations for reporting queries. What replication should they configure?

A. Locally redundant storage (LRS)
B. Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
C. Geo-redundant storage with read access (RA-GRS)
D. Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** RA-GRS replicates data to a secondary region and provides read access to the secondary, enabling reporting queries during normal operations. During failover, the secondary becomes read-write. LRS (A) and ZRS (B) don't provide cross-region replication. GZRS (D) provides zone + geo redundancy but requires RA-GZRS for read access to secondary.

**Key Concept:** [Storage Redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy)
</details>

### Question 19
**Scenario:** A company needs to design secure data access for an application. The application runs on Azure VMs and needs to access Azure SQL Database and Blob Storage without storing credentials in code or configuration.

A. Store connection strings in App Settings
B. Use Managed Identity for the VMs with Azure RBAC for Blob and Azure AD authentication for SQL
C. Store credentials in Key Vault and retrieve at runtime
D. Use service account with password

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Managed Identity provides an Azure AD identity for VMs without credential management. Azure RBAC assigns blob access permissions to the identity. Azure SQL supports Azure AD authentication with managed identity. No credentials to store or rotate. Key Vault (C) still requires credentials to access Key Vault initially. App Settings (A) and service accounts (D) expose credentials.

**Key Concept:** [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
</details>

### Question 20
**Scenario:** A company needs to build a real-time data pipeline that ingests millions of events per second from IoT devices, processes them, and stores results for analytics. What architecture should they design?

A. Direct database inserts
B. Azure Event Hubs for ingestion, Azure Stream Analytics for processing, Azure Synapse for storage
C. Azure Queue Storage
D. Azure Service Bus

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Event Hubs handles millions of events per second with partitioning. Stream Analytics provides real-time processing with SQL-like queries. Synapse stores processed data for analytics. This is the standard Azure streaming architecture. Direct inserts (A) can't handle the scale. Queue Storage (C) and Service Bus (D) aren't designed for high-throughput streaming ingestion.

B. Azure Site Recovery for VMs with 1-hour replication, Azure SQL geo-replication
C. Multi-region active-active deployment
D. No DR needed

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Azure Site Recovery replicates VMs to a secondary region continuously (meeting 1-hour RPO). Recovery can be initiated within the 4-hour RTO. Azure SQL geo-replication provides continuous async replication. Daily backups (A) have 24-hour RPO. Active-active (C) exceeds requirements and costs more. DR is needed (D) to meet objectives.

**Key Concept:** [Azure Site Recovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview)
</details>

### Question 22

A. Azure Backup with VM backup and 30-day retention
B. Storage account snapshots only
C. Azure Site Recovery
D. Manual scripts to copy VHDs

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: A**

**Why:** Azure Backup provides application-consistent backups with 30-day (or longer) retention. It supports both full VM recovery and file-level recovery from recovery points. Managed by backup policies. Snapshots (B) don't provide managed retention or file-level recovery. Site Recovery (C) is for DR replication, not point-in-time backup. Manual scripts (D) are error-prone.

**Key Concept:** [Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction)
</details>

### Question 23
**Scenario:** A company needs their web application to remain available even if an entire Azure region fails. They need automatic failover with minimal data loss. What architecture should they design?

A. Single region with Availability Zones
B. Multi-region active-passive with Azure Front Door, geo-replicated databases, and Azure Site Recovery
C. Multiple VMs in single region
D. On-premises DR site

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Multi-region architecture with geo-replicated databases provides near-zero RPO. Azure Front Door provides global load balancing with automatic failover based on health probes. Azure Site Recovery replicates VMs to secondary region. This ensures availability during regional failures. Single region (A, C) doesn't survive regional failures. On-premises (D) adds complexity.

**Key Concept:** [Multi-region Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/redundancy)
</details>

### Question 24
**Scenario:** A company needs to test their disaster recovery plan without impacting production. They want to validate that applications work correctly in the DR region. What should they use?

A. Failover production to DR region
B. Azure Site Recovery test failover to isolated network
C. Manual documentation review
D. Third-party DR testing tool

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Site Recovery test failover creates VMs in the DR region connected to an isolated network. This allows testing application functionality without affecting production or consuming replication bandwidth. After testing, cleanup removes test resources. Production failover (A) impacts users. Documentation review (C) doesn't validate actual recovery. Third-party (D) adds complexity.

**Key Concept:** [Test Failover](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure)
</details>

### Question 25
**Scenario:** A company's database requires zero data loss (RPO = 0) during failover. They use Azure SQL Database. What should they configure?

A. Geo-replication with asynchronous replication
B. Auto-failover groups with synchronous replication in Business Critical tier
C. LRS backup
D. Manual backup and restore

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Auto-failover groups with Business Critical tier use synchronous replication within the primary region, providing RPO = 0 for zone failures. For regional failures, async geo-replication has near-zero RPO but not guaranteed zero. Note: True RPO = 0 across regions isn't possible due to physics. Business Critical provides best possible protection. Async (A) has potential data loss. Backups (C, D) have longer RPO.

**Key Concept:** [Auto-failover Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/auto-failover-group-overview)

**Scenario:** A company needs to design a network architecture for 50 application environments that require isolation from each other but shared connectivity to on-premises. They want centralized security controls. What should they design?

A. 50 separate VNets with individual VPN connections
B. Hub-spoke topology with Azure Firewall in hub, spoke VNets for applications, VNet peering, and VPN/ExpressRoute in hub
C. Single flat VNet with NSGs
D. Azure Virtual WAN with secured hubs

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Hub-spoke provides isolation (each spoke is separate) with shared services (firewall, VPN) in hub. VNet peering connects spokes to hub. Azure Firewall in hub provides centralized security. Single VPN/ExpressRoute in hub reduces cost. Separate VNets with VPNs (A) is expensive. Single VNet (C) lacks isolation. Virtual WAN (D) is also valid but hub-spoke is more traditional for this scale.

**Key Concept:** [Hub-Spoke Topology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke)
</details>

### Question 27
**Scenario:** A web application needs to handle 1 million requests per second with sub-second response times. The application is stateless and runs on containers. What compute platform should they design?

B. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with horizontal pod autoscaling and cluster autoscaler
C. Azure Container Instances
D. Azure Functions Consumption plan

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** AKS provides container orchestration with horizontal pod autoscaling (scale pods based on metrics) and cluster autoscaler (scale nodes). It handles high throughput with low latency when properly configured. VMs (A) require manual container management. ACI (C) doesn't scale as well for consistent high load. Functions Consumption (D) has cold start issues.

**Key Concept:** [AKS Autoscaling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler)
</details>

### Question 28
**Scenario:** A company needs to run Windows-based batch processing jobs that run for 4-6 hours. Jobs are triggered weekly and don't need to run continuously. They want to minimize cost.

A. Always-on VMs
B. Azure Batch with low-priority VMs
C. Azure Functions
D. Azure App Service

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Azure Batch manages large-scale batch workloads with job scheduling. Low-priority VMs (Spot) provide significant cost savings for interruptible workloads. Jobs that can checkpoint and resume are ideal. Functions (C) has 10-minute max execution (60 min for premium). Always-on VMs (A) waste money when idle. App Service (D) is for web apps.

**Key Concept:** [Azure Batch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview)

**Scenario:** A company's API receives 1000 requests per second during peak hours but only 10 requests per second at night. They want to minimize cost while maintaining performance. What compute solution should they design?

A. VM Scale Set with fixed capacity for peak
B. Azure App Service with autoscaling
C. Azure API Management with Azure Functions Premium plan
D. Always-on AKS cluster

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: C**

**Why:** API Management provides API gateway capabilities. Functions Premium plan scales quickly (pre-warmed instances) based on demand and scales to zero during low traffic, minimizing cost. APIM with consumption tier is even more cost-effective for variable load. Fixed capacity (A) wastes money at night. App Service (B) works but Functions is more cost-effective for variable loads.

**Key Concept:** [Functions Premium Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan)
</details>

### Question 30
**Scenario:** A company needs to deploy a hybrid application with components on-premises and in Azure. The on-premises component must initiate connections to Azure (on-premises firewall blocks inbound). What connectivity should they design?

A. Site-to-Site VPN
B. Azure Relay Hybrid Connections
C. ExpressRoute
D. Public endpoints with IP whitelisting

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Azure Relay Hybrid Connections uses outbound connections from on-premises (through firewalls) to establish bidirectional communication. No inbound firewall rules needed. Ideal for scenarios where on-premises initiates but Azure needs to send data back. S2S VPN (A) and ExpressRoute (C) require firewall configuration. Public endpoints (D) expose services.

**Key Concept:** [Azure Relay](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/relay-hybrid-connections-protocol)
</details>

### Question 31

### Question 34
**Scenario:** A company needs to migrate 500 VMs from VMware to Azure within 6 months. They need minimal changes to the applications. What migration approach should they design?

A. Rebuild all applications cloud-native
B. Azure Migrate with agentless replication for assessment and migration
C. Manual VHD export and import
D. Azure Site Recovery only

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Azure Migrate provides discovery, assessment, and agentless replication for VMware VMs. It handles dependency mapping to identify migration groups. Replication enables minimal downtime cutover. Rebuilding (A) is time-consuming for 500 VMs. Manual export (C) doesn't scale. Site Recovery (D) is part of Azure Migrate's migration tools.

### Question 35
**Scenario:** A company needs to secure their web application against common attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and DDoS. What should they design?

A. NSG rules only
B. Azure Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Azure DDoS Protection
C. On-premises firewall
D. Azure Firewall only

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Application Gateway WAF protects against OWASP top 10 including SQL injection and XSS. Azure DDoS Protection Standard provides DDoS mitigation. Together they provide comprehensive web application security. NSGs (A) are Layer 4, can't inspect HTTP. On-premises firewall (C) doesn't help cloud apps. Azure Firewall (D) is Layer 4, not WAF.

### Question 36
**Scenario:** A company wants to implement GitOps for their AKS cluster. Configuration changes should be pulled from a Git repository and automatically applied to the cluster.

A. Manual kubectl apply commands
B. Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes with Flux extension for GitOps
C. Azure DevOps pipelines only
D. Helm charts stored locally

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Flux (GitOps operator) continuously reconciles cluster state with Git repository. Azure Arc integration provides management and monitoring. Changes to Git automatically propagate to the cluster. True GitOps pattern. Manual commands (A) aren't automated. Pipelines (C) are push-based, not GitOps. Local Helm (D) isn't GitOps.

</details>

### Question 37
**Scenario:** A company needs private connectivity between Azure and their office network. They require consistent performance, low latency, and the connection should not traverse the public internet. Bandwidth need is 200 Mbps.

A. Site-to-Site VPN
B. ExpressRoute with 200 Mbps circuit
C. Point-to-Site VPN
D. Azure Bastion

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** ExpressRoute provides private, dedicated connectivity not over public internet. It offers consistent latency and performance. 200 Mbps circuits are available. S2S VPN (A) uses internet. P2S VPN (C) is for individual users. Bastion (D) is for VM access.

**Key Concept:** [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction)
</details>

### Question 38
**Scenario:** A company needs to deploy the same application stack to 10 Azure regions for a global application. They want to manage infrastructure as code with consistent deployments.

A. Manual deployment in each region
B. Bicep templates with deployment stacks or Azure DevOps pipelines for multi-region deployment
C. Copy resources using the portal
D. Separate templates for each region

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Bicep (or ARM) templates define infrastructure as code. Deployment stacks or CI/CD pipelines can deploy the same template to multiple regions consistently. Parameters can vary per region while template stays same. Manual (A, C) doesn't scale. Separate templates (D) cause configuration drift.

</details>

### Question 39
**Scenario:** A company wants to provide developers with self-service access to create pre-approved VM configurations. VMs should be auto-shutdown at night and have budget limits per developer.

A. Give developers full subscription access
B. Azure DevTest Labs with pre-configured VM bases, auto-shutdown policies, and per-user quotas
C. Azure Blueprints
D. Manual VM creation requests

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** DevTest Labs provides self-service VM provisioning from pre-approved images. Auto-shutdown policies reduce costs. Per-user cost quotas prevent overspending. Claim-based VMs allow sharing. Full access (A) lacks controls. Blueprints (C) are for environment standards, not self-service. Manual requests (D) slow development.

**Key Concept:** [Azure DevTest Labs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview)
</details>

### Question 40
**Scenario:** A company is designing a microservices application. Services need to discover each other, load balance between instances, and communicate securely with mutual TLS. What should they design?

A. Hard-coded service endpoints
B. Azure Kubernetes Service with service mesh (Istio or Linkerd)
C. Azure Load Balancer
D. DNS-based discovery only

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Correct: B**

**Why:** Service mesh provides service discovery, load balancing, and mTLS between services automatically. Istio or Linkerd on AKS handles communication concerns. Sidecar proxies manage traffic without application changes. Hard-coded (A) doesn't scale. Load Balancer (C) doesn't provide mTLS. DNS (D) doesn't provide load balancing or security.
