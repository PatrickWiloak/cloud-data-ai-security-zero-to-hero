# AI/ML Engineer Roadmap

A complete AI/ML engineer journey: foundation concepts → hands-on builds → certifications → mastery. Certs are one pillar, not the whole path.

---

## Before the certs: foundation concepts

Modern AI engineering is mostly using LLMs well, retrieving the right context, exposing the right tools, and shipping with evals. These plain-English concept pages get you from "knows the buzzwords" to "can reason about LLM systems":

- **[LLM basics](../learn/concepts/llm-basics.md)** - tokens, context windows, sampling, what LLMs are good and bad at
- **[Transformer architecture](../learn/concepts/transformer-architecture.md)** - attention, what's actually under the hood
- **[Embeddings and vector search](../learn/concepts/embeddings-and-vector-search.md)** - the substrate of semantic search
- **[Prompt engineering](../learn/concepts/prompt-engineering.md)** - the unglamorous superpower
- **[RAG explained](../learn/concepts/rag-explained.md)** - retrieval-augmented generation in practice
- **[Fine-tuning vs RAG](../learn/concepts/fine-tuning-vs-rag.md)** - how to choose
- **[AI agents explained](../learn/concepts/agents-explained.md)** - tool use, ReAct, agent failure modes
- **[Evals for LLMs](../learn/concepts/evals-for-llms.md)** - the practice that separates demos from production

Or follow the structured **[AI from Scratch](../learn/ai-from-scratch.md)** path - 8 phases for builders, no PhD math required.

## Hands-on builds

Read less, ship more. The fastest path to AI engineering competence is wiring real systems end-to-end:

- **[Deploy an ML model](./hands-on-projects/deploy-ml-model.md)** - the production-serving fundamentals
- **[Build a 3-tier app](./hands-on-projects/deploy-3-tier-app.md)** - the substrate any AI app sits on
- **[Build a data pipeline](./hands-on-projects/build-data-pipeline.md)** - what feeds your models
- **[Set up monitoring and observability](./hands-on-projects/setup-monitoring-stack.md)** - critical for eval drift

See [resources/hands-on-projects/](./hands-on-projects/) for all 10 guided builds.
