# Hands-on projects

Guided cloud builds. Each has an estimated time, a goal you can articulate to an interviewer, and inline code or commands. Most run on free-tier accounts.

Data, security and AI builds live on the sibling sites: [build a data pipeline](https://data.noblerworks.com/resources/hands-on-projects/build-data-pipeline/) on Data Zero to Hero, [implement zero trust](https://security.noblerworks.com/resources/hands-on-projects/implement-zero-trust/) on Security Zero to Hero, and [RAG, agents, model serving and fine-tuning builds](https://ai.noblerworks.com/build/projects/build-rag-pipeline/) on AI Zero to Hero.

## Cloud builds

| Build | Time | What you'll have at the end |
|---|---|---|
| [Deploy a 3-tier app](./deploy-3-tier-app.md) | 3-4 hours | LB → app servers → DB on AWS, Azure, or GCP |
| [Build a CI/CD pipeline](./build-ci-cd-pipeline.md) | 4-5 hours | Auto-build, test, and deploy on commit |
| [Set up a monitoring stack](./setup-monitoring-stack.md) | 3-4 hours | Prometheus + Grafana + alertmanager wired end-to-end |
| [Set up a Kubernetes cluster](./kubernetes-cluster-setup.md) | 4-5 hours | Production-shaped cluster, ingress, observability |
| [Build infra with Terraform](./terraform-infrastructure.md) | 3-4 hours | VPC + compute + DB declared as code, with state |
| [Build a serverless app](./serverless-application.md) | 3-4 hours | API + queue + function + storage, event-driven |
| [Run a DR drill](./disaster-recovery-drill.md) | 4-6 hours | Tested failover, measured RTO/RPO |

## How to pick

- **First-ever cloud build:** [Deploy a 3-tier app](./deploy-3-tier-app.md). Touches networking, compute, identity, and storage in one project.
- **Interview prep:** [Set up a Kubernetes cluster](./kubernetes-cluster-setup.md), [Build infra with Terraform](./terraform-infrastructure.md), [Build a CI/CD pipeline](./build-ci-cd-pipeline.md). These map to the most common practitioner questions.
- **Cheapest to run:** serverless and Terraform (free-tier friendly).
- **Most production-shaped:** [Run a DR drill](./disaster-recovery-drill.md), [Set up a monitoring stack](./setup-monitoring-stack.md).
- **Which build backs which exam:** [Labs by certification](./labs-by-cert.md).

## Which lab for which cert

Each lab maps to the certs it exercises. The reverse index lives in [labs-by-cert.md](./labs-by-cert.md).
