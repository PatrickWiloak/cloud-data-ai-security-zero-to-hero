# Cloud Engineer Roadmap

> A complete cloud engineer journey: foundation concepts → hands-on builds → certifications → mastery. The cert path is one piece of the picture, not the whole picture.

---

## Before the certs: foundation concepts

If you're new, build mental models before exam prep. These plain-English pages give you the substrate every cloud engineer is reasoning from:

- **[Day One: terminal, git, HTTP, servers](../learn/day-one/)** - if you've never touched a terminal, start here
- **[What is cloud computing?](../learn/concepts/what-is-cloud-computing.md)** - the foundational mental model
- **[IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS](../learn/concepts/iaas-paas-saas.md)** - the three terms that come up daily
- **[Regions and availability zones](../learn/concepts/regions-and-availability-zones.md)** - where your code physically runs
- **[Shared responsibility model](../learn/concepts/shared-responsibility-model.md)** - what the cloud provider does vs what you do
- **[VPC explained](../learn/concepts/vpc-explained.md)** - networking inside the cloud
- **[Containers vs VMs](../learn/concepts/containers-vs-vms.md)** - why containers won
- **[Kubernetes in 10 minutes](../learn/concepts/kubernetes-in-10-minutes.md)** - the orchestrator everyone deploys
- **[Serverless explained](../learn/concepts/serverless-explained.md)** - the no-server-management option
- **[Terraform explained](../learn/concepts/terraform-explained.md)** - infrastructure as code
- **[CI/CD explained](../learn/concepts/cicd-explained.md)** - the automated deployment loop

Or follow the structured **[Cloud from Scratch](../learn/cloud-from-scratch.md)** path - 8 phases, no exam scaffolding.

## Hands-on builds before (or alongside) certs

The biggest gap between cert holders and effective engineers is shipped systems. Pair every cert with at least one of these:

- **[Deploy a 3-tier application](./hands-on-projects/deploy-3-tier-app.md)**
- **[Build a CI/CD pipeline](./hands-on-projects/build-ci-cd-pipeline.md)**
- **[Set up monitoring and observability](./hands-on-projects/setup-monitoring-stack.md)**
- **[Provision infrastructure with Terraform](./hands-on-projects/terraform-infrastructure.md)**
- **[Set up a Kubernetes cluster](./hands-on-projects/kubernetes-cluster-setup.md)**
- **[Run a disaster recovery drill](./hands-on-projects/disaster-recovery-drill.md)**

See [resources/hands-on-projects/](./hands-on-projects/) for all 10 guided builds.
