## Key Takeaways

1. **Cloud Run** and **Azure Container Apps** blur the line between serverless and containers - offering scale-to-zero with container flexibility
2. **Lambda** has the most mature ecosystem but is constrained to 15-minute execution time
3. **Azure Functions Premium Plan** eliminates cold starts - unique among the big three
4. **EventBridge** leads in event routing with schema registry and archive/replay capabilities
5. **Logic Apps** offers the most pre-built connectors (1,000+) for enterprise integration
6. **Step Functions** provides the cleanest workflow-as-state-machine model
7. For exam prep, understand the trade-offs between event-driven and request-driven architectures
8. All three providers are converging on **CloudEvents** as the standard event format
