# Service Comparison - DevOps and CI/CD

## Overview

This guide compares CI/CD services, infrastructure as code tools, and DevOps platforms across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and popular third-party options like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI. Understanding these tools is essential for DevOps and platform engineering certification exams.

## CI/CD Pipeline Patterns

### Recommended Architecture per Cloud

**AWS Pipeline Architecture:**
```
GitHub/CodeCommit -> CodePipeline -> CodeBuild -> ECR -> CodeDeploy -> ECS/EKS
                                        |
                                   CodeArtifact (packages)
                                   Inspector (scanning)
```

**Azure Pipeline Architecture:**
```
Azure Repos/GitHub -> Azure Pipelines -> ACR -> Azure Pipelines (release) -> AKS/App Service
                                          |
                                     Azure Artifacts
                                     Defender for DevOps
```

**GCP Pipeline Architecture:**
```
GitHub/CSR -> Cloud Build -> Artifact Registry -> Cloud Deploy -> GKE/Cloud Run
                                    |
                              Artifact Analysis
                              Binary Authorization

## Key Takeaways

1. **Azure DevOps** provides the most complete all-in-one DevOps platform (repos, boards, pipelines, artifacts, test plans)
2. **GitHub Actions** offers the best developer experience and marketplace ecosystem
3. **AWS CodePipeline** is most suitable when deep AWS integration is required
4. **Cloud Build** is cost-effective and provides strong supply chain security (SLSA Level 3)
5. **GitLab CI/CD** excels in built-in security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)
6. Most organizations use a hybrid approach - GitHub/GitLab for source + cloud-native tools for deployment
7. GitOps (Flux/ArgoCD) is becoming the standard for Kubernetes deployments across all clouds
8. Supply chain security (SBOM, signing, provenance) is increasingly important for exam questions
