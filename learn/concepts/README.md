# 💡 Concepts - Bite-Size Topic Pages

> **Single-topic explanations. 5-10 minute reads. No exam scaffolding.**
>
> Read one when you keep seeing a term and want to actually understand it.

## How these are organized

Each page covers one concept:
- What it is, in plain English
- Why it exists (the problem it solves)
- A small concrete example
- What to look at next

These are not exam-objective summaries. They're "explain it like I'm a smart engineer who just hasn't been exposed to this yet."

If you want exam coverage, head back to the [Study Hub](../../STUDY-HUB.md).

**Brand new to all of this?** Start with **[Day One](../day-one/)** - terminal, git, HTTP, and servers - then come back here once that vocabulary feels familiar.

**Want a curated path through these?** Try **[Cloud from Scratch](../cloud-from-scratch.md)** or **[AI from Scratch](../ai-from-scratch.md)**, which order the concepts into 8-phase paths.

**Want them grouped by subject across the whole repo?** See the **[topic indexes](../../topics/)**.
